# Graduate Teaching Plan for AlgoBook

## Learning Taxonomy Levels

**L1 - Remember**: Recall facts, terms, definitions, procedures
- *Example*: "Define what constitutes a valid algorithm" → Student states: "An algorithm is a finite sequence of unambiguous instructions that transforms inputs to outputs"
- *Example*: "List the steps of binary search" → Student recites the divide-and-conquer steps from memory
- *Example*: "State the definition of Big-O notation" → Student recalls the formal mathematical definition

**L2 - Understand**: Explain concepts, interpret meanings, translate between representations
- *Example*: "Explain why binary search requires sorted input" → Student describes how the comparison-based elimination depends on ordering
- *Example*: "Interpret this algorithm's pseudocode and describe what it accomplishes" → Student reads pseudocode and explains it finds the maximum element
- *Example*: "Translate between recursive and iterative implementations" → Student converts recursive factorial to iterative version

**L3 - Apply**: Use knowledge in new situations, execute procedures, implement solutions
- *Example*: "Implement binary search for a new data type (strings)" → Student adapts the binary search algorithm to work with alphabetically sorted strings
- *Example*: "Use loop invariants to verify this sorting algorithm" → Student applies invariant methodology to prove bubble sort correctness
- *Example*: "Apply divide-and-conquer to solve the maximum subarray problem" → Student implements the recursive solution

**L4 - Analyze**: Break down complex problems, identify patterns, examine relationships
- *Example*: "Analyze why quicksort performs poorly on already-sorted arrays" → Student examines partition behavior and identifies worst-case scenarios
- *Example*: "Compare the space-time tradeoffs of different graph representations" → Student analyzes adjacency matrix vs. adjacency list trade-offs
- *Example*: "Identify the algorithmic pattern in these three different problems" → Student recognizes that scheduling, graph coloring, and resource allocation all use greedy approaches

**L5 - Evaluate**: Make judgments based on criteria, compare alternatives, critique solutions
- *Example*: "Evaluate which sorting algorithm is best for real-time systems" → Student weighs worst-case guarantees, memory usage, and implementation complexity
- *Example*: "Critique this proof of algorithm correctness" → Student identifies flawed reasoning in an induction proof
- *Example*: "Judge whether this approximation algorithm is acceptable for the given constraints" → Student assesses approximation ratio against performance requirements

**L6 - Create**: Design original solutions, synthesize ideas, generate new algorithms
- *Example*: "Design a data structure for efficiently finding the k-th smallest element with updates" → Student creates novel combination of heap and balanced tree
- *Example*: "Develop an algorithm for a new computational problem in bioinformatics" → Student synthesizes string matching and dynamic programming for gene sequence analysis
- *Example*: "Generate a proof technique for analyzing randomized algorithms" → Student creates new mathematical framework combining probability theory with algorithmic analysis
