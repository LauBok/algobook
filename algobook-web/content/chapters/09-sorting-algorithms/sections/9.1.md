# Sorting Algorithms

Sorting is a fundamental operation in computer science that enables efficient data retrieval and analysis. From database queries to search engines, sorted data structures form the foundation for many algorithmic optimizations.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will:
- Understand how sorting enables efficient algorithms like binary search
- Analyze the performance limitations of quadratic sorting algorithms
- Recognize sorting applications in databases and data analysis
- Connect divide-and-conquer techniques to efficient sorting

## Sorting as an Algorithmic Foundation

Consider searching for an entry in a phone book with 1 million names. In an unsorted book, you might need to check every entry—up to 1 million operations. In a sorted book, binary search finds any entry in approximately 20 operations.

```note title="Search Efficiency"
Linear search in unsorted data: $O(n)$ time complexity
Binary search in sorted data: $O(\log n)$ time complexity
For n = 1,000,000: linear search needs up to 1,000,000 operations while binary search needs ~20 operations.
```

## Sorting Enables Advanced Algorithms

Sorting serves as a prerequisite for many efficient algorithms. Binary search, introduced in Chapter 8, requires sorted input but reduces search complexity from $O(n)$ to $O(\log n)$.

```python-execute
# Demonstrate how sorting enables binary search
def binary_search(arr, target):
    """Binary search - only works on sorted arrays!"""
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    comparisons = 0
    
    while left <= right:
        comparisons += 1
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        print(f"Comparison {comparisons}: checking position {mid}, value {arr[mid]}")
        
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid, comparisons
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    
    return -1, comparisons

# Try it with a sorted array
numbers = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25]
position, steps = binary_search(numbers, 15)

print(f"\nFound 15 at position {position} in just {steps} comparisons!")
print(f"Linear search would need up to {len(numbers)} comparisons")
```

Algorithms requiring sorted data:
- Database queries: SQL ORDER BY and efficient JOIN operations
- Statistical analysis: median, quartile, and duplicate detection
- Graphics rendering: Z-buffering for depth ordering
- Data compression: Huffman coding optimization
- Computational geometry: line sweep algorithms

## Applications

### Database Management
```python-execute
# Simulate a simple database operation
customers = [
    {"name": "Alice Johnson", "purchase_amount": 150},
    {"name": "Bob Smith", "purchase_amount": 2500},
    {"name": "Carol Davis", "purchase_amount": 75},
    {"name": "David Wilson", "purchase_amount": 1200},
    {"name": "Eve Brown", "purchase_amount": 300}
]

# Sort by purchase amount (descending) to find top customers
top_customers = sorted(customers, key=lambda x: x["purchase_amount"], reverse=True)

print("Top customers by purchase amount:")
for i, customer in enumerate(top_customers, 1):
    print(f"{i}. {customer['name']}: ${customer['purchase_amount']}")
```

### Scientific Data Analysis
```python-execute
# Analyzing experimental data
import random

# Simulate temperature readings
temperatures = [random.uniform(18.5, 24.5) for _ in range(20)]
print(f"Raw data: {[round(t, 1) for t in temperatures[:10]]}...")

# Sort to find statistical measures
sorted_temps = sorted(temperatures)
n = len(sorted_temps)

median = sorted_temps[n//2] if n % 2 == 1 else (sorted_temps[n//2-1] + sorted_temps[n//2]) / 2
q1 = sorted_temps[n//4]
q3 = sorted_temps[3*n//4]

print(f"\nAfter sorting:")
print(f"Minimum: {min(sorted_temps):.1f}°C")
print(f"Q1 (25th percentile): {q1:.1f}°C") 
print(f"Median: {median:.1f}°C")
print(f"Q3 (75th percentile): {q3:.1f}°C")
print(f"Maximum: {max(sorted_temps):.1f}°C")
```

## Quadratic Sorting Limitations

Chapter 4 introduced bubble sort, which works correctly but has $O(n^2)$ time complexity. This quadratic growth becomes problematic for large datasets.

```python-execute
import time

def bubble_sort(arr):
    """The bubble sort we learned earlier"""
    n = len(arr)
    comparisons = 0
    
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n - i - 1):
            comparisons += 1
            if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:
                arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]
    
    return comparisons

# Test with different sizes
sizes = [100, 500, 1000]
for size in sizes:
    # Create random data
    import random
    data = list(range(size))
    random.shuffle(data)
    
    # Time bubble sort
    start_time = time.time()
    comparisons = bubble_sort(data.copy())
    elapsed_time = time.time() - start_time
    
    print(f"Size {size}: {comparisons:,} comparisons, {elapsed_time:.4f} seconds")
```

```plot
type: line
title: Bubble Sort Performance - The Scalability Problem
data:
  - name: "Bubble Sort O(n²)"
    x: [500, 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500, 3000, 3500, 4000, 4500, 5000]
    y: [0.025, 0.1, 0.225, 0.4, 0.625, 0.9, 1.225, 1.6, 2.025, 2.5]
  - name: "Efficient Sort O(n log n)"
    x: [500, 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500, 3000, 3500, 4000, 4500, 5000]
    y: [0.027, 0.06, 0.0948, 0.132, 0.1758, 0.2202, 0.2652, 0.312, 0.3588, 0.3984]
options:
  xLabel: "Array Size"
  yLabel: "Time (seconds)"
  interactive: true
```

```note title="Scalability Analysis"
For n = 1,000,000 items, bubble sort requires approximately $n^2 = 10^{12}$ comparisons. At 1 billion comparisons per second, this would take over 16 minutes of computation time.
```

```

## Divide and Conquer Approach

The divide-and-conquer paradigm from Chapter 6 provides a path to more efficient sorting algorithms:

1. Divide the sorting problem into smaller subproblems
2. Recursively solve each subproblem
3. Combine the solutions efficiently

This approach yields algorithms like merge sort and quicksort, which achieve $O(n \log n)$ performance.

```note title="Chapter Overview"
This chapter covers two efficient sorting algorithms:
- Merge sort: guaranteed $O(n \log n)$ performance, stable sorting
- Quicksort: average $O(n \log n)$, efficient in-place sorting

We also establish the theoretical lower bound of $O(n \log n)$ for comparison-based sorting algorithms.
```

## Key Takeaways

- $O(n^2)$ algorithms become impractical for large datasets due to quadratic growth
- Many applications rely on sorted data for optimal performance
- Divide-and-conquer techniques achieve $O(n \log n)$ sorting complexity
- Algorithm selection depends on understanding complexity trade-offs
