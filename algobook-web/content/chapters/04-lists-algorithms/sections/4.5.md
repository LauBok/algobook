# Insertion Sort and Algorithm Correctness

## Introduction to Insertion Sort

Having mastered bubble sort, we now examine an important principle: **multiple algorithms can solve the same problem using different approaches**. Understanding various algorithmic strategies enables selecting the most appropriate solution for each situation.

This section introduces **insertion sort**, an algorithm that parallels natural human sorting behavior. Consider organizing playing cards dealt one at a time: typically you pick up each card and insert it into its correct position among the already organized cards in your hand.

### The Card Sorting Analogy

Consider the process of organizing playing cards dealt sequentially:

1. **First card (7)**: Place it in your hand → `[7]`
2. **Second card (3)**: Insert it before 7 → `[3, 7]`
3. **Third card (9)**: Insert it after 7 → `[3, 7, 9]`
4. **Fourth card (1)**: Insert it before 3 → `[1, 3, 7, 9]`
5. **Fifth card (5)**: Insert it between 3 and 7 → `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`

**Key insight**: At each step, the cards in your hand maintain sorted order, and you insert each new card into its correct position.

This natural approach translates directly into an algorithmic strategy:
- **Sorted portion**: Cards already in hand (left side of array)
- **Unsorted portion**: Cards yet to be dealt (right side of array)
- **Current element**: The next card being inserted

### Insertion Sort Algorithm

initialData: [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
options:
  height: 400

```

### Implementation and Analysis

```python-execute
print("=== Insertion Sort Step-by-Step Implementation ===")
data = [5, 2, 4, 6, 1]
print(f"Starting array: {data}")
print()

n = len(data)

for i in range(1, n):  # Start from second element
    key = data[i]  # Current element to insert
    print(f"Step {i}: Inserting {key} into sorted portion {data[:i]}")

    # Find correct position and shift elements
    j = i - 1
    while j >= 0 and data[j] > key:
        print(f"  {data[j]} > {key}, shift {data[j]} right")
        data[j + 1] = data[j]  # Shift element right
        j -= 1

    # Insert the key at correct position
    data[j + 1] = key
    print(f"  Insert {key} at position {j + 1}")
    print(f"  Array now: {data}")
    print()

print(f"Final sorted array: {data}")
```

## Algorithm Comparison: Bubble Sort vs Insertion Sort

Having examined both algorithms, we can compare their fundamental approaches and characteristics.

### Algorithmic Strategies

**Bubble Sort Approach:**
- Compare adjacent element pairs
- Swap elements if they are in wrong order
- Largest elements "bubble up" to their final positions
- Builds sorted region from the end (right side)

**Insertion Sort Approach:**
- Take next element from unsorted portion
- Find its correct position within sorted portion
- Shift elements to create space
- Insert element in correct position
- Builds sorted region from the beginning (left side)

### Performance Characteristics

Both algorithms exhibit quadratic worst-case behavior, but their practical performance differs significantly:

**Time Complexity:**
- **Worst Case**: Both algorithms are O(n²) when input is reverse-sorted
- **Best Case**: Insertion sort is O(n) on already-sorted data; bubble sort is O(n²) without optimization, O(n) with early termination
- **Average Case**: Both are O(n²), but insertion sort typically performs fewer operations

**Practical Performance:**
- **Bubble Sort**: Consistently poor performance, many unnecessary swaps even on partially sorted data
- **Insertion Sort**: Adapts well to input characteristics—performs excellently on nearly-sorted data with minimal data movements
- **Small Datasets**: Insertion sort generally preferred due to lower constant factors and better cache performance
- **Memory Usage**: Both sort in-place with O(1) auxiliary space

    explanation: "Both algorithms perform comparisons and data movements, though in different patterns."
```

## Algorithm Correctness and Formal Verification

### The Need for Mathematical Certainty

When developing algorithms for critical applications, empirical testing alone is insufficient. Consider scenarios where correctness is absolutely essential:

- **Medical devices** calculating drug dosages
- **Flight control systems** managing aircraft trajectories
- **Banking software** processing financial transactions
- **Autonomous vehicle** navigation algorithms
- **Structural engineering** load calculations
- **Cryptographic security** protocols

In these domains, "it appears to work" provides inadequate assurance. **Mathematical certainty** about algorithm correctness becomes essential.

### Limitations of Testing

Testing algorithms with examples is valuable but inherently limited. Consider this flawed "sorting" algorithm:

```python
def broken_sort(arr):
    # This algorithm assumes input is already sorted
    return arr
```

This broken algorithm passes certain test cases:
- Input: `[1, 2, 3]` → Output: `[1, 2, 3]` ✓
- Input: `[5, 7, 9]` → Output: `[5, 7, 9]` ✓

But fails on unsorted inputs:
- Input: `[3, 1, 4]` → Output: `[3, 1, 4]` ✗ (not sorted)
- Input: `[5, 2, 8]` → Output: `[5, 2, 8]` ✗ (not sorted)

**Fundamental principle**: Proofs must work for **all possible inputs**, not merely the examples tested. Testing demonstrates the presence of bugs but cannot prove their absence.

### Loop Invariants: A Formal Verification Technique

To prove correctness of algorithms containing loops, computer scientists employ **loop invariants**—statements that remain true throughout loop execution.

A loop invariant must satisfy three properties:
1. **Initialization**: True before the loop begins
2. **Maintenance**: If true before an iteration, remains true afterward
3. **Termination**: When combined with loop termination, establishes algorithm correctness

### Example: Maximum Element Algorithm

**Algorithm:**
```python
max_val = arr[0]
for i in range(1, len(arr)):
    if arr[i] > max_val:
        max_val = arr[i]
```

**Loop Invariant:**
> "`max_val` contains the maximum element of `arr[0...i-1]`"

**Formal Proof:**
- **Initialization**: Before loop starts, `max_val = arr[0]` = maximum of `arr[0...0]` ✓
- **Maintenance**: Assume the invariant holds at the start of iteration i, meaning `max_val` contains the maximum of `arr[0...i-1]`. Now we examine `arr[i]`:
  - **Case 1**: If `arr[i] > max_val`, then `arr[i]` is larger than all previous elements, so we update `max_val = arr[i]`. Now `max_val` equals the maximum of `arr[0...i]`.
  - **Case 2**: If `arr[i] ≤ max_val`, then `max_val` remains larger than or equal to all elements in `arr[0...i]`, so `max_val` still equals the maximum of `arr[0...i]`.

  In both cases, the invariant is preserved for the next iteration ✓
- **Termination**: When loop ends, `i = len(arr)`, so `max_val` = maximum of `arr[0...len(arr)-1]` = maximum of entire array ✓

```python-execute
print("=== Maximum Element Algorithm with Invariant Verification ===")
arr = [3, 7, 2, 9, 1, 5]
print(f"Array: {arr}")
print()

max_val = arr[0]
print(f"Initialization: max_val = {max_val} (max of arr[0:1] = {arr[0:1]})")

for i in range(1, len(arr)):
    print(f"Iteration {i}: Checking arr[{i}] = {arr[i]}")
    if arr[i] > max_val:
        max_val = arr[i]
        print(f"  New maximum found: {max_val}")
    else:
        print(f"  {arr[i]} ≤ {max_val}, no change")
    print(f"  Invariant: max_val = {max_val} = max({arr[0:i+1]})")

print(f"\nTermination: max_val = {max_val} = maximum of entire array")
```

### Proving Insertion Sort Correctness

**Algorithm Structure:**
```python
for i in range(1, len(arr)):
    key = arr[i]
    # Insert key into sorted position within arr[0...i-1]
    # (shifting elements as necessary)
```

**Loop Invariant:**
> "At the start of iteration i, subarray `arr[0...i-1]` contains the same elements as the original `arr[0...i-1]`, but in sorted order"

**Formal Proof:**
- **Initialization**: Before first iteration (`i=1`), `arr[0...0]` contains one element, which is trivially sorted ✓

- **Maintenance**: Assume the invariant holds at the start of iteration i: `arr[0...i-1]` is sorted and contains the same elements as originally. We now insert `arr[i]` into its correct position:
  - We find the correct position by comparing `arr[i]` with elements in the sorted portion
  - We shift larger elements one position right to make space
  - We insert `arr[i]` at the correct position
  - The resulting `arr[0...i]` is sorted (correct ordering maintained) and contains all original elements from `arr[0...i]` (no elements lost or duplicated)
  - Thus the invariant is preserved for the next iteration ✓

- **Termination**: When loop terminates, `i = len(arr)`, so the invariant tells us `arr[0...len(arr)-1]` (the entire array) is sorted and contains all original elements ✓

```python-execute
print("=== Insertion Sort Correctness Verification ===")
original = [5, 2, 4, 6, 1]
arr = original.copy()
print(f"Original array: {original}")
print()

n = len(arr)
for i in range(1, n):
    print(f"Iteration {i}:")
    print(f"  Before: sorted portion arr[0:{i}] = {arr[:i]}")
    print(f"          unsorted portion arr[{i}:] = {arr[i:]}")
    print(f"  Invariant check: Is {arr[:i]} sorted? {arr[:i] == sorted(arr[:i])}")

    # Perform insertion
    key = arr[i]
    j = i - 1
    while j >= 0 and arr[j] > key:
        arr[j + 1] = arr[j]
        j -= 1
    arr[j + 1] = key

    print(f"  After inserting {key}: {arr}")
    print(f"  New sorted portion: arr[0:{i+1}] = {arr[:i+1]}")
    print(f"  Invariant maintained: Is {arr[:i+1]} sorted? {arr[:i+1] == sorted(arr[:i+1])}")
    print()

print(f"Final result: {arr}")
print(f"Correctness verification:")
print(f"  All elements sorted? {arr == sorted(original)}")
print(f"  Same elements as original? {sorted(arr) == sorted(original)}")
```

### Proving Bubble Sort Correctness

**Loop Invariant (outer loop):**
> "At the start of iteration i, the largest i elements occupy their final sorted positions in `arr[n-i...n-1]`"

**Formal Proof:**
- **Initialization**: Before first iteration (`i=0`), no elements are claimed to be in final positions. The invariant trivially holds since we claim the largest 0 elements are in position ✓

- **Maintenance**: Assume the invariant holds at the start of iteration i: the largest i elements are in their final positions at `arr[n-i...n-1]`. During iteration i:
  - The inner loop compares adjacent pairs and swaps when necessary
  - The largest element among `arr[0...n-i-1]` "bubbles up" to position `n-i-1`
  - This element is larger than any in `arr[0...n-i-2]` and smaller than or equal to any in `arr[n-i...n-1]`
  - Now the largest i+1 elements occupy positions `arr[n-i-1...n-1]`, preserving the invariant ✓

- **Termination**: When the outer loop completes (`i = n-1`), the largest n-1 elements are in their final positions. Since there are only n elements total, the remaining element must also be in its correct position (the smallest element at index 0). Therefore, the entire array is sorted ✓

```

## Practice and Application

Apply loop invariant reasoning to verify algorithm correctness:

Consider this linear search algorithm:

```python
def linear_search(arr, target):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i] == target:
            return i
    return -1
```

```quiz
id: linear-search-invariant
question: "What is the correct loop invariant for the linear search algorithm above?"
options:
  - id: target-found
    text: "At the start of iteration i, target has been found in `arr[0...i-1]`"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This is incorrect because if the target were found, the function would have already returned."
  - id: target-not-found
    text: "At the start of iteration i, target is not present in `arr[0...i-1]`"
    correct: true
    explanation: "Correct! This invariant captures that we haven't found the target in the portion we've already examined."
  - id: array-sorted
    text: "At the start of iteration i, `arr[0...i-1]` is sorted"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Linear search doesn't require the array to be sorted, so this is not a relevant invariant."
  - id: index-bounds
    text: "At the start of iteration i, `0 ≤ i ≤ len(arr)`"
    correct: false
    explanation: "While this is true, it's just a loop bound condition, not a meaningful loop invariant for proving correctness."
```

**Reflection Exercise:** For additional practice, try proving the three properties (initialization, maintenance, termination) for the correct loop invariant above.
