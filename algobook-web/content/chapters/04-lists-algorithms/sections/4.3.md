# List Manipulation and Modification

## Introduction

In previous sections, you learned to create and search through contact lists. However, real contact management systems need to be dynamic - users must be able to add new contacts, remove old ones, and update information as it changes.

This section shows you how to modify lists during program execution.

```python-execute
print("=== Dynamic Contact Management ===")
contacts = ["Alice Smith", "Bob Wilson"]
print("Initial contacts:", contacts)

# Add a new contact
contacts.append("Sarah Johnson")
print("Added new contact:", contacts)

# Remove a contact that moved away
contacts.remove("Bob Wilson")
print("Removed contact:", contacts)

print("Contact lists can change as needed.")
```

## Adding New Contacts

Real contact systems need to add new contacts as people join your network. Python provides several methods for adding items to lists:

### Adding Individual Contacts

```python-execute
print("=== Adding Individual Contacts ===")
contacts = ["Alice Smith", "Bob Wilson"]
print("Current contacts:", contacts)

# append() adds to the end
contacts.append("Sarah Johnson")
print("Added Sarah:", contacts)

# insert() adds at specific position
contacts.insert(0, "David Brown")  # Add at beginning
print("Added David at start:", contacts)

print("Contact list now has", len(contacts), "people")
```

### Adding Multiple Contacts

```python-execute
print("=== Adding Multiple Contacts ===")
work_contacts = ["Alice Smith", "Bob Wilson"]
family_contacts = ["Mom", "Dad", "Sister"]

print("Work contacts:", work_contacts)
print("Family contacts:", family_contacts)

# extend() adds each contact individually
all_contacts = work_contacts.copy()
all_contacts.extend(family_contacts)
print("Combined contacts:", all_contacts)

print("Total contacts:", len(all_contacts))
```

## Removing Contacts

Contact systems also need to remove contacts when people move away or are no longer relevant:

```python-execute
print("=== Removing Contacts ===")
contacts = ["Alice Smith", "Bob Wilson", "Sarah Johnson", "David Brown"]
print("Current contacts:", contacts)

# remove() removes first occurrence of contact
contacts.remove("Bob Wilson")  # Bob moved away
print("Removed Bob:", contacts)

# pop() removes and returns contact at specific position
last_contact = contacts.pop()  # Remove last contact
print("Removed:", last_contact)
print("Remaining contacts:", contacts)

print("Contact list now has", len(contacts), "people")
```

## Finding Contact Information

Contact systems need to search for and verify contact information:

```python-execute
print("=== Finding Contact Information ===")
contacts = ["Alice Smith", "Bob Wilson", "Alice Smith", "Sarah Johnson"]
print("Contacts:", contacts)

# count() returns how many times a contact appears
alice_count = contacts.count("Alice Smith")
print("Alice Smith appears", alice_count, "times")

# index() returns position of first occurrence
bob_position = contacts.index("Bob Wilson")
print("Bob Wilson is at position", bob_position)

# Check if contact exists with 'in'
print("Is Sarah Johnson in contacts?", "Sarah Johnson" in contacts)
print("Is David Brown in contacts?", "David Brown" in contacts)
```

## Combining List Operations

Let's combine these list operations to manage contacts effectively:

```python-execute
print("=== Interactive Contact System ===")
contacts = ["Alice Smith", "Bob Wilson"]
print("Starting contacts:", contacts)

# Simulate adding new contacts
new_contacts = ["Sarah Johnson", "David Brown", "Emma Davis"]
print("Adding new contacts:", new_contacts)

for contact in new_contacts:
    contacts.append(contact)
    print(f"Added: {contact}")

print("Updated contacts:", contacts)
print("Total contacts:", len(contacts))

# Remove a contact who moved away
if "Bob Wilson" in contacts:
    contacts.remove("Bob Wilson")
    print("Removed Bob Wilson (moved away)")

print("Final contacts:", contacts)
```

## Practical Contact Management Tasks

### Building Contact Lists from Input

Real contact systems often need to collect contacts from user input:

```python-execute
print("=== Building Contact Lists from Input ===")
contacts = []

# Simulate collecting contact names
new_contacts = ["Alice Smith", "Bob Wilson", "Sarah Johnson", "David Brown"]
print("Adding contacts from input:", new_contacts)

for contact in new_contacts:
    if contact not in contacts:  # Avoid duplicates
        contacts.append(contact)
        print(f"Added: {contact}")
    else:
        print(f"Skipped duplicate: {contact}")

print("Final contact list:", contacts)
print("Total unique contacts:", len(contacts))
```

### Contact List Cleanup

Contact systems need to clean up and organize contact lists:

```python-execute
print("=== Contact List Cleanup ===")
# Contact list with some issues
messy_contacts = ["Alice Smith", "", "Bob Wilson", "Alice Smith", "Sarah Johnson"]
print("Original contacts:", messy_contacts)

# Clean up the list
clean_contacts = []
for contact in messy_contacts:
    # Skip empty contacts and avoid duplicates
    if contact and contact not in clean_contacts:
        clean_contacts.append(contact)

print("Cleaned contacts:", clean_contacts)
print("Removed", len(messy_contacts) - len(clean_contacts), "problematic entries")
```

## Key Takeaways

You have learned to build dynamic contact management systems using essential list operations:

### **Adding Contacts:**
- **`append()`** - add individual contacts to the end of the list
- **`insert()`** - add contacts at specific positions
- **`extend()`** - add multiple contacts from another list

### **Removing Contacts:**
- **`remove()`** - remove specific contacts by name
- **`pop()`** - remove contacts at specific positions
- Check if contacts exist before removing to avoid errors

### **Finding Contact Information:**
- **`count()`** - count how many times a contact appears
- **`index()`** - find the position of a contact
- **`in` operator** - check if a contact exists in the list

### **Building Real Contact Systems:**
- Combine operations to create interactive contact management
- Avoid duplicate contacts by checking before adding
- Clean up contact lists by removing empty or duplicate entries

  print("After adding contacts:", contacts)

  # TODO: Remove "Bob Wilson" from the contacts
  # Use remove() to remove the contact

  # TODO: Check if "Alice Smith" is in the contacts
