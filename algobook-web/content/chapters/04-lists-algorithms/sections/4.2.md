# List Processing with Loops

## The Breakthrough Moment: When Lists Meet Loops

In Section 4.1, you discovered how lists solve the "multiple variables" problem. But lists by themselves are just containers sitting there, waiting to be useful. The real breakthrough comes when you combine lists with the loop patterns you mastered in Chapter 3.

This combination unlocks something extraordinary: **algorithmic thinking**. You're about to discover that you can write code once that processes *any amount* of data—10 items, 1000 items, or even 100,000 items—with the exact same elegant approach.

```python-execute
print("=== The Power Unleashed: Lists + Loops ===")
# Before: Could only work with individual values
# Now: Can process any amount of data with the same code!

small_dataset = [78, 85, 92, 88, 76]
large_dataset = [78, 85, 92, 88, 76, 94, 89, 73, 88, 91, 83, 89, 95, 79, 86, 
                 92, 84, 77, 90, 88, 82, 93, 87, 96, 81, 74, 93, 85, 89, 94]

print(f"Processing {len(small_dataset)} test scores...")
# Find scores above 90 - works for any size!
high_scores_small = []
for score in small_dataset:
    if score >= 90:
        high_scores_small.append(score)
        
print(f"High scores in small dataset: {high_scores_small}")

print(f"\nProcessing {len(large_dataset)} test scores...")
high_scores_large = []
for score in large_dataset:
    if score >= 90:
        high_scores_large.append(score)
        
print(f"High scores in large dataset: {high_scores_large}")
print("\n🎯 Same algorithm, different data sizes - this is the power of scalable code!")
```

```note title="You Just Learned Scalability"
This is one of the most important concepts in computer science: writing code that works for small problems AND large problems. The same patterns you're learning here power everything from analyzing 50 survey responses to processing millions of financial transactions.
```

**This changes everything about how you approach problems.** You can now:
- Process survey responses from 10 people or 10,000 people
- Analyze financial data for a week or a decade  
- Search through 100 products or 100,000 products
- **Build algorithms that solve real-world problems**

But first, you need to understand how to loop through lists effectively.

## Two Ways to Loop Through Lists

Before we dive into complex algorithms, you need to master the fundamental skill of looping through lists. Python gives you two main approaches, and knowing when to use each one is crucial:

### Direct Iteration: Focus on the Data

When you care about the *values*, use direct iteration:

```python-execute
print("=== Direct Iteration: Clean and Readable ===")
favorite_colors = ["red", "green", "blue", "yellow", "purple"]

print("Method 1: Direct iteration (most common)")
for color in favorite_colors:
    print(f"I like the color {color}")

print("\nThis is the Pythonic way - clean, readable, and efficient!")
```

### Index-Based Iteration: When Position Matters

Sometimes you need more than just the values—you need to know *where* each item is located, or you need to work with multiple related lists simultaneously. That's when index-based iteration shines:

```python-execute
print("=== Index-Based Iteration: When You Need Positions ===")
students = ["Alice", "Bob", "Carol", "David", "Eve"]

print("Method 2: Using indices when positions matter")
for i in range(len(students)):
    student = students[i]
    position = i + 1  # Convert to human-friendly numbering
    print(f"Student #{position}: {student}")

print(f"\nProcessed {len(students)} students with their rankings!")
```

```hint title="Choosing Your Loop Style"
- Use **direct iteration** (`for item in list`) when you only care about the values themselves
- Use **index-based** (`for i in range(len(list))`) when you need to know positions, modify the list, or coordinate multiple lists
```

### Working with Related Data

Real programs often have multiple related lists that must be processed together:

```python-execute
print("=== Processing Related Data Together ===")
student_names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Carol", "David", "Eve"]
test_scores = [87, 92, 78, 85, 94]
letter_grades = ["B+", "A-", "C+", "B", "A"]

print("📊 Complete Grade Report:")
for i in range(len(student_names)):
    name = student_names[i]
    score = test_scores[i]
    grade = letter_grades[i]
    print(f"  {name}: {score} points → {grade}")

print(f"\nGenerated report for {len(student_names)} students automatically!")
```

```quiz
id: iteration-choice
question: "You have a list of product names and a separate list of their prices. You need to print each product with its price. Which iteration method should you use?"
options:
  - id: direct
    text: "Direct iteration (for product in products)"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Direct iteration only gives you access to one list at a time. You need positions to match products with their prices."
  - id: index-based
    text: "Index-based iteration (for i in range(len(products)))"
    correct: true
    explanation: "Correct! You need indices to access corresponding elements from both the product names list and the prices list."
  - id: both
    text: "Use both methods simultaneously"
    correct: false
    explanation: "You can only use one iteration method at a time in a single loop."
  - id: doesnt-matter
    text: "Either method works equally well"
    correct: false
    explanation: "When working with multiple related lists, you need index-based iteration to access corresponding elements."
```

## The Four Universal Patterns of Data Processing

Here's a profound insight that every programmer eventually discovers: when you're processing collections of data, you're almost always doing one of just **four fundamental things**. These aren't arbitrary categories—they're the natural patterns that emerge from real-world problems.

Master these four patterns, and you'll be able to tackle any data processing challenge:

1. **Building up a result** (like calculating totals)
2. **Counting things** (like tallying occurrences)
3. **Selecting items** (like filtering based on criteria)
4. **Transforming items** (like converting data)

Let's explore each pattern with practical examples.

### Pattern 1: The Accumulator - Building Up Results

The accumulator pattern is your go-to tool whenever you need to **build up** a single result by processing multiple items. Think totals, averages, products—anything where you start with an initial value and grow it by examining each element:

```python-execute
print("=== Pattern 1: The Accumulator ===")
daily_expenses = [45.50, 23.75, 67.25, 12.00, 89.90, 34.25]

print("Daily expenses:", daily_expenses)
print("Goal: Calculate total spending step by step")

# The Accumulator Pattern
total_spent = 0  # Start with nothing
print(f"Starting total: ${total_spent:.2f}")

for expense in daily_expenses:
    total_spent = total_spent + expense  # Accumulate each value
    print(f"  Added ${expense:.2f} → Running total: ${total_spent:.2f}")

print(f"\n💰 Final total: ${total_spent:.2f}")
print(f"✓ Verification with sum(): ${sum(daily_expenses):.2f}")
```

**Pattern Recognition**: Whenever you need to calculate totals, averages, products, or any "build up" operation, you're using the accumulator pattern.

### Pattern 2: The Counter - Tallying Occurrences

The counter pattern answers "how many?" questions. Whenever you need to **count** items that meet certain criteria, this is your tool:

```python-execute
print("=== Pattern 2: The Counter ===") 
temperatures = [72, 85, 91, 78, 88, 95, 82, 77, 89, 93, 76, 84]

print("Daily temperatures:", temperatures)
print("Goal: Count how many days were hot (85°F or higher)")

# The Counter Pattern
hot_days = 0  # Start counting at zero
print(f"Starting count: {hot_days}")

for temp in temperatures:
    if temp >= 85:
        hot_days = hot_days + 1  # Increment when condition met
        print(f"  Found hot day: {temp}°F (count now: {hot_days})")

print(f"\n🌡️ Total hot days: {hot_days} out of {len(temperatures)}")
percentage = (hot_days / len(temperatures)) * 100
print(f"That's {percentage:.1f}% of all days!")
```

**Pattern Recognition**: Whenever you need to count occurrences, frequencies, or "how many" questions, you're using the counter pattern.

### Pattern 3: The Filter - Selecting Qualified Items

The filter pattern helps you **select** only the items you care about, creating a new collection that contains just the elements meeting your criteria:

```python-execute
print("=== Pattern 3: The Filter ===")
all_test_scores = [45, 78, 92, 67, 88, 73, 95, 82, 59, 91, 76, 85]

print("All test scores:", all_test_scores)
print("Goal: Extract only the passing scores (70 or higher)")

# The Filter Pattern
passing_scores = []  # Start with empty collection
print(f"Starting with empty list: {passing_scores}")

for score in all_test_scores:
    if score >= 70:  # Check qualification criteria
        passing_scores.append(score)  # Add qualifying items
        print(f"  Added passing score: {score}")

print(f"\n✅ Passing scores: {passing_scores}")
print(f"Pass rate: {len(passing_scores)}/{len(all_test_scores)} students")
```

**Pattern Recognition**: Whenever you need to extract, select, or filter data based on conditions, you're using the filter pattern.

### Pattern 4: The Transformer - Converting Data

The transformer pattern **converts** each element according to some rule, creating a new collection with the transformed results:

```python-execute
print("=== Pattern 4: The Transformer ===")
celsius_temperatures = [0, 10, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40]

print("Temperatures in Celsius:", celsius_temperatures)  
print("Goal: Convert each temperature to Fahrenheit")

# The Transformer Pattern
fahrenheit_temperatures = []  # Start with empty collection
print(f"Starting with empty list: {fahrenheit_temperatures}")

for celsius in celsius_temperatures:
    fahrenheit = (celsius * 9/5) + 32  # Apply transformation rule
    fahrenheit_temperatures.append(fahrenheit)  # Collect transformed result
    print(f"  {celsius}°C → {fahrenheit}°F")

print(f"\n🌡️ Fahrenheit temperatures: {fahrenheit_temperatures}")
```

**Pattern Recognition**: Whenever you need to convert, transform, or apply the same operation to every item, you're using the transformer pattern.

```note title="The Foundation of All Data Processing"
These four patterns appear in virtually every program that works with collections. Once you recognize them, complex data processing problems become much simpler—you just identify which pattern (or combination of patterns) you need and implement it. Professional developers rely on these patterns daily.
```

```quiz
id: pattern-recognition
question: "You have a list of student ages and want to find how many students are 18 or older. Which pattern should you use?"
options:
  - id: accumulator
    text: "Accumulator - build up a total"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Accumulator builds up values. You need to count occurrences, not sum values."
  - id: counter  
    text: "Counter - count items meeting criteria"
    correct: true
    explanation: "Perfect! You're counting how many students meet the age criteria (≥18). This is exactly what the counter pattern does."
  - id: filter
    text: "Filter - select qualifying items"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Filter would give you the actual ages of students ≥18. You want the count, not the ages themselves."
  - id: transformer
    text: "Transformer - convert each item"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Transformer changes each item. You're not changing ages, you're counting them."
```

## Beyond Simple Lists: Nested Data Structures

So far, you've worked with lists containing simple data types like numbers and strings. But Python's lists are incredibly flexible—they can contain **any type of data**, including other lists! This creates powerful nested structures that can represent complex, real-world data.

### Python's Ultimate Flexibility: Mixed-Type Lists

Unlike arrays in some other languages, Python lists don't require all elements to be the same type. You can mix numbers, strings, lists, and any other Python objects:

```python-execute
print("=== Python's Flexible Lists ===")

# Mixed types in a single list
mixed_data = [42, "hello", [1, 2, 3], True, 3.14]
print("Mixed list:", mixed_data)
print("Type of each element:")
for i, item in enumerate(mixed_data):
    print(f"  Element {i}: {item} (type: {type(item).__name__})")

print()

# Even more complex mixing
complex_data = [
    42,                          # Just a number
    ["Alice", 85, True],         # List with mixed types
    "standalone string",         # Just a string
    [["nested", "list"], 99],    # List containing another list and number
]

print("Complex mixed structure:")
for i, item in enumerate(complex_data):
    print(f"  Element {i}: {item}")
```

### Nested Lists: Lists Inside Lists

When a list contains other lists as elements, we call it a **nested list**. This creates hierarchical data structures:

```python-execute
print("=== Understanding Nested Lists ===")

# Student data: each student is a list of [name, score1, score2, score3]
student_grades = [
    ["Alice", 85, 92, 78],
    ["Bob", 90, 88, 85], 
    ["Charlie", 78, 82, 90]
]

print("Student grades (name and 3 test scores):")
for student in student_grades:
    name = student[0]
    scores = student[1:]  # Everything except first element
    average = sum(scores) / len(scores)
    print(f"  {name}: {scores} → Average: {average:.1f}")
```

### Irregular Nested Lists: Real-World Flexibility

Here's where Python really shines—nested lists don't need to be "rectangular matrices." Each inner list can have different lengths and contain different types:

```python-execute
print("=== Irregular Nested Lists: Real-World Data ===")

# Different lengths - perfectly valid!
family_data = [
    ["Smith Family", "John", "Jane", "Bobby", "Sue"],          # 5 members
    ["Johnson Family", "Mike", "Lisa"],                        # 3 members  
    ["Brown Family", "David", "Sarah", "Tom", "Emma", "Jake"], # 6 members
    ["Single Person", "Alex"]                                  # 2 elements
]

print("Family information (irregular lengths):")
for family in family_data:
    family_name = family[0]
    members = family[1:]
    print(f"  {family_name}: {len(members)} members - {members}")

print()

# Contact database with different available information
contacts = [
    ["John Smith", "john@email.com", "555-0123"],
    ["Jane Doe", "jane@email.com"],  # No phone number
    ["Bob Wilson", "bob@email.com", "555-0456", "555-0789"],  # Two phone numbers
    ["Alice Brown", "alice@email.com", "555-0321", ["Manager", "Engineering"]]  # Job info
]

print("Contact database with irregular structure:")
for contact in contacts:
    name = contact[0]
    email = contact[1] 
    
    # Handle different amounts of additional info
    additional_info = contact[2:] if len(contact) > 2 else []
    
    print(f"  Name: {name}")
    print(f"    Email: {email}")
    if additional_info:
        print(f"    Additional info: {additional_info}")
    print()
```

### Accessing Nested List Elements

Use multiple square brackets to "drill down" into nested structures:

```python-execute
print("=== Accessing Nested Elements ===")

# Grade matrix (but still irregular!)
grade_book = [
    ["Math", [85, 92, 78, 88]],
    ["Science", [90, 85]],
    ["History", [78, 82, 90, 95, 87]]
]

print("Gradebook structure:")
for subject_data in grade_book:
    subject = subject_data[0]
    grades = subject_data[1]
    print(f"  {subject}: {grades}")

print(f"\nAccessing specific elements:")
print(f"First subject name: {grade_book[0][0]}")        # "Math"
print(f"First grade in Math: {grade_book[0][1][0]}")    # 85
print(f"Second grade in Science: {grade_book[1][1][1]}")  # 85

# Safe access when lengths vary
print(f"\nSafe processing of irregular data:")
for subject_data in grade_book:
    subject = subject_data[0]
    grades = subject_data[1]
    
    print(f"{subject}:")
    for i, grade in enumerate(grades):
        print(f"  Test {i+1}: {grade}")
    
    avg = sum(grades) / len(grades)
    print(f"  Average: {avg:.1f}")
    print()
```

### Processing Nested Lists with Loops

Combine nested loops to process nested data:

```python-execute
print("=== Processing Nested Data ===")

# Game board (tic-tac-toe style)
game_board = [
    ["X", "O", "X"],
    ["O", "X", "O"],
    ["O", "X", "X"]
]

print("Game board:")
for row_num, row in enumerate(game_board):
    print(f"Row {row_num}: {row}")

# Count X's and O's
x_count = 0
o_count = 0

for row in game_board:
    for cell in row:
        if cell == "X":
            x_count += 1
        elif cell == "O":
            o_count += 1

print(f"\nGame statistics:")
print(f"X's: {x_count}")
print(f"O's: {o_count}")

print()

# Find all scores above 85 in gradebook
print("=== Finding High Scores Across All Subjects ===")
grade_book = [
    ["Math", [85, 92, 78, 88]],
    ["Science", [90, 85]],
    ["History", [78, 82, 90, 95, 87]]
]

high_scores = []
for subject_data in grade_book:
    subject = subject_data[0]
    grades = subject_data[1]
    
    for grade in grades:
        if grade >= 90:
            high_scores.append([subject, grade])

print("High scores (90+):")
for score_info in high_scores:
    subject, score = score_info
    print(f"  {subject}: {score}")
```

### Working Safely with Irregular Data

When working with nested lists of different sizes, always check lengths to avoid errors:

```python-execute
print("=== Safe Programming with Irregular Lists ===")

irregular_data = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5],  
    [6, 7, 8, 9, 10],
    []  # Empty list!
]

print("Safely processing irregular data:")
for i, sublist in enumerate(irregular_data):
    print(f"Row {i} (length {len(sublist)}):")
    
    if len(sublist) == 0:
        print("    (empty)")
    else:
        for j, item in enumerate(sublist):
            print(f"    [{j}]: {item}")
        
        # Safe calculations
        total = sum(sublist)
        avg = total / len(sublist)
        print(f"    Sum: {total}, Average: {avg:.1f}")
    print()
```

### Quiz: Understanding Nested Lists

```quiz
id: nested-lists-quiz
question: "What will be the output of `print(data[1][2])`?\n\n```python\ndata = [\n    [\"apple\", \"banana\"], \n    [\"red\", \"green\", \"blue\"],\n    [10, 20]\n]\n```"
options:
  - id: blue
    text: "\"blue\""
    correct: true
    explanation: "Correct! `data[1]` is `['red', 'green', 'blue']`, and `data[1][2]` is the element at index 2, which is `'blue'`."
  - id: green
    text: "\"green\"" 
    correct: false
    explanation: "`data[1][2]` accesses index 2, not index 1. Index 2 in `['red', 'green', 'blue']` is `'blue'`."
  - id: 20
    text: "20"
    correct: false
    explanation: "`data[1]` accesses the second list `['red', 'green', 'blue']`, not the third list `[10, 20]`."
  - id: error
    text: "IndexError"
    correct: false
    explanation: "The list `data[1]` has 3 elements, so index 2 is valid and will return `'blue'`."
```

**Key Insights about Nested Lists:**

- **Ultimate Flexibility**: Lists can contain any types, including other lists
- **Irregular Structure**: Each sublist can have different lengths and types
- **Real-World Modeling**: Perfect for representing complex data like contact info, gradebooks, or hierarchical menus
- **Access Pattern**: Use `data[row][column]` syntax to access nested elements
- **Safe Processing**: Always check `len()` when working with irregular data
- **Loop Combination**: Use nested loops to process nested data structures

You now understand how Python's flexible list system can represent virtually any kind of structured data you encounter in the real world!

## Your First Real Algorithm: Linear Search

Now that you understand the four processing patterns, it's time to put them together to solve one of computing's classic problems: **finding a specific item in a collection of data**.

This might sound simple, but think about how often you do this: looking up a contact in your phone, finding a song in a playlist, or searching for a product on a shopping website. The technique you're about to learn—**linear search**—is the foundation of all search operations.

```python-execute
print("=== Algorithm: Linear Search ===")
product_ids = [101, 205, 89, 156, 73, 198, 44, 167]
target_id = 156

print(f"🔍 Searching for product ID {target_id}")
print(f"Search data: {product_ids}")
print("Algorithm: Check each element until we find our target")

# Linear Search Implementation
found_at_index = -1  # -1 means "not found yet"
steps_taken = 0

for i in range(len(product_ids)):
    current_id = product_ids[i]
    steps_taken = steps_taken + 1
    print(f"Step {steps_taken}: Checking index {i} → ID {current_id}")
    
    if current_id == target_id:
        found_at_index = i
        print(f"    🎯 FOUND IT! Product {target_id} is at index {i}")
        break  # Stop searching - we found what we wanted
    else:
        print(f"    {current_id} ≠ {target_id}, continue searching...")

if found_at_index != -1:
    print(f"\n✅ Success: Found product {target_id} at index {found_at_index}")
    print(f"Required {steps_taken} steps to find it")
else:
    print(f"\n❌ Product {target_id} not found in inventory")
    print(f"Searched entire list in {steps_taken} steps")
```

```note title="You Just Implemented a Fundamental Algorithm!"
Congratulations! You just implemented **linear search**—one of the foundational algorithms in computer science. This exact approach powers search functionality in databases, contact lists, inventory systems, and countless other applications. You're now thinking like a computer scientist!
```

### Understanding Search Performance

```python-execute
print("=== Understanding Algorithm Performance ===")
inventory = [15, 28, 7, 42, 91, 66, 33, 58]

def linear_search_with_stats(data, target):
    """Perform linear search and return (found_index, comparisons_made)"""
    comparisons = 0
    for i in range(len(data)):
        comparisons = comparisons + 1
        if data[i] == target:
            return i, comparisons  # Found it!
    return -1, comparisons  # Not found

print("Inventory:", inventory)
print("Testing different search scenarios:")

# Test various positions
test_targets = [15, 42, 58, 99]  # first, middle, last, missing

for target in test_targets:
    index, steps = linear_search_with_stats(inventory, target)
    if index != -1:
        print(f"Target {target}: FOUND at index {index} ({steps} comparisons)")
    else:
        print(f"Target {target}: NOT FOUND ({steps} comparisons required)")
```

**Key Insights about Algorithm Performance:**
- **Best case**: Target is the first element (1 comparison)
- **Average case**: Target is somewhere in the middle (N/2 comparisons)  
- **Worst case**: Target is last or missing (N comparisons)

This analysis helps you understand how algorithms behave with different data sizes and patterns.

## Finding Extremes: Maximum and Minimum Values

Another category of problems you'll encounter constantly involves finding the "best" or "worst" item in a collection—the highest grade, the lowest price, the most popular product. Let's implement the algorithms that solve these problems:

### Finding the Maximum Element

```python-execute
print("=== Algorithm: Finding Maximum Element ===")
quiz_scores = [78, 92, 65, 88, 95, 73, 91, 82]

print("Quiz scores:", quiz_scores)
print("Algorithm: Track the highest value seen so far")

# Find Maximum Algorithm
current_max = quiz_scores[0]  # Assume first element is maximum
max_index = 0
print(f"Initial assumption: max = {current_max} at index 0")

for i in range(1, len(quiz_scores)):  # Start from second element
    current_score = quiz_scores[i]
    print(f"Checking position {i}: {current_score}")
    
    if current_score > current_max:
        current_max = current_score
        max_index = i
        print(f"    🔥 New maximum found: {current_max}")
    else:
        print(f"    {current_score} ≤ {current_max}, no change")

print(f"\n🏆 Highest score: {current_max} at position {max_index}")
print(f"✓ Verification with max(): {max(quiz_scores)}")
```

### Finding the Minimum Element

```python-execute
print("=== Algorithm: Finding Minimum Element ===")
product_prices = [12.99, 8.50, 15.75, 6.25, 9.99, 11.50]

print("Product prices:", product_prices)
print("Algorithm: Track the lowest value seen so far")

```warning title="Algorithm Correctness"
Notice we start the loop from index 1, not 0. This is crucial! We've already used the first element as our starting assumption for the maximum. If we started from index 0, we'd be comparing the first element with itself, which would never trigger an update.
```

## Real-World Applications: Combining Patterns

Now let's see the real power of these patterns by combining them to solve complex, realistic problems. Professional software combines multiple patterns just like this.

### Complete Student Analytics System

```python-execute
print("=== Student Performance Analytics ===")
# Multiple related datasets - common in real applications
students = ["Alice", "Bob", "Carol", "David", "Eve", "Frank"]
test1_scores = [85, 78, 92, 67, 89, 74]
test2_scores = [88, 82, 89, 73, 91, 78] 
test3_scores = [92, 79, 94, 71, 87, 82]

print(f"📊 Analyzing performance for {len(students)} students")

# Calculate individual averages (Transformer pattern)
student_averages = []
print("Individual Performance:")

for i in range(len(students)):
    name = students[i]
    avg = (test1_scores[i] + test2_scores[i] + test3_scores[i]) / 3
    student_averages.append(avg)
    print(f"  {name}: Tests({test1_scores[i]}, {test2_scores[i]}, {test3_scores[i]}) = {avg:.1f} avg")

# Class statistics (Accumulator pattern)  
class_average = sum(student_averages) / len(student_averages)
print(f"\n📈 Class Statistics:")
print(f"Class average: {class_average:.1f}")

# Find top performer (Maximum finding algorithm)
highest_average = max(student_averages)
top_student_index = -1
for i in range(len(student_averages)):
    if student_averages[i] == highest_average:
        top_student_index = i
        break

print(f"Top performer: {students[top_student_index]} ({highest_average:.1f})")

# Count above-average students (Counter pattern)
above_average_count = 0
for avg in student_averages:
    if avg > class_average:
        above_average_count = above_average_count + 1

print(f"Students above class average: {above_average_count}/{len(students)}")

# Identify struggling students (Filter pattern)
struggling_students = []
for i in range(len(students)):
    if student_averages[i] < 75:
        struggling_students.append(students[i])

print(f"Students needing support (<75 avg): {struggling_students}")
```

### Business Intelligence Dashboard

```python-execute
print("=== Sales Intelligence Dashboard ===")
# Multi-dimensional business data
products = ["Laptop", "Mouse", "Keyboard", "Monitor", "Headphones"]
units_sold = [12, 45, 23, 8, 31]
unit_prices = [999.99, 25.50, 79.99, 299.99, 149.99]
target_sales = [15, 50, 25, 10, 35]

print("📊 Sales Performance Analysis:")

# Calculate revenue and performance (Transformer + Analysis)
total_revenue = 0
underperforming_products = []

for i in range(len(products)):
    product = products[i]
    sold = units_sold[i]
    price = unit_prices[i]
    target = target_sales[i]
    
    revenue = sold * price
    total_revenue = total_revenue + revenue  # Accumulator
    
    performance = "✅ MEETING TARGET" if sold >= target else "⚠️ BELOW TARGET"
    if sold < target:
        underperforming_products.append(product)  # Filter
    
    print(f"  {product}: {sold}/{target} units @ ${price:.2f} = ${revenue:.2f} [{performance}]")

# Business insights
print(f"\n💰 Financial Summary:")
print(f"Total revenue: ${total_revenue:.2f}")

# Find most profitable product (Maximum with transformation)
highest_revenue = 0
most_profitable_product = ""

for i in range(len(products)):
    product_revenue = units_sold[i] * unit_prices[i]
    if product_revenue > highest_revenue:
        highest_revenue = product_revenue
        most_profitable_product = products[i]

print(f"Most profitable: {most_profitable_product} (${highest_revenue:.2f})")
print(f"Products needing attention: {underperforming_products}")
```

```note title="This Is Professional Programming"
Notice how this example combines multiple patterns to solve a complex problem:
- **Accumulator** for calculating totals and averages
- **Counter** for tracking classifications  
- **Filter** for identifying specific subsets
- **Transformer** for mathematical calculations
- **Search algorithms** for locating specific items

This combination of fundamental patterns is exactly how professional software systems are built!
```

## Understanding Scalability: Why Performance Matters

As you start working with larger datasets, you'll need to understand how your algorithms perform. The techniques you've learned work great for small amounts of data, but what happens when you're processing thousands or millions of items?

```python-execute
print("=== Algorithm Scalability Analysis ===")

def time_linear_search(data_size, target_position):
    """Simulate linear search performance"""
    # In real linear search, we'd need target_position comparisons
    return target_position

# Compare performance on different data sizes
small_list_size = 100
large_list_size = 10000

print("Linear Search Performance Comparison:")

scenarios = [
    ("Best case", 1),  # Target at beginning
    ("Average case", lambda size: size // 2),  # Target in middle  
    ("Worst case", lambda size: size)  # Target at end
]

for scenario_name, position_func in scenarios:
    if callable(position_func):
        small_comparisons = position_func(small_list_size)
        large_comparisons = position_func(large_list_size)
    else:
        small_comparisons = position_func
        large_comparisons = position_func
    
    print(f"{scenario_name}:")
    print(f"  Small list ({small_list_size} items): {small_comparisons} comparisons")
    print(f"  Large list ({large_list_size} items): {large_comparisons} comparisons")
    
    if small_comparisons > 1:  # Avoid division by zero
        multiplier = large_comparisons / small_comparisons
        print(f"  Performance scales by factor of {multiplier:.1f}x")
    print()

print("💡 Key insight: Linear algorithms scale proportionally with data size")
print("   This becomes crucial when processing millions of records!")
```

```quiz
id: algorithm-performance
question: "You're searching for a specific customer ID in a database. The database grows from 1,000 customers to 100,000 customers. Using linear search, how does this affect worst-case performance?"
options:
  - id: no-change
    text: "Performance stays the same"
    correct: false
    explanation: "More data means more elements to potentially search through."
  - id: 100x-worse
    text: "Takes about 100 times longer in the worst case"
    correct: true
    explanation: "Correct! Linear search scales proportionally. 100,000 ÷ 1,000 = 100x more comparisons needed in worst case."
  - id: slightly-worse
    text: "Takes slightly longer but not much different"
    correct: false
    explanation: "The difference is dramatic - 100 times more comparisons required."
  - id: unpredictable
    text: "Performance change is unpredictable"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Linear search performance is very predictable - it scales directly with data size."
```
