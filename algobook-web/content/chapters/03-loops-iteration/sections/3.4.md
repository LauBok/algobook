# Practice and Review

You've learned the fundamental concepts of loops and repetition. This section applies these skills to implement the complete contact search algorithm from section 1.1, demonstrating how loops transform algorithmic thinking into executable code.

## Implementing the Contact Search Algorithm

Recall the contact search algorithm from section 1.1:

> **ALGORITHM: Sequential Contact Search**
> 1. Start at the first contact in the list
> 2. Compare current contact with target name
> 3. If match found, return contact information
> 4. If no match, move to next contact
> 5. **Repeat until target found or list exhausted**

You now have all the tools needed to implement this algorithm using the loops and conditional logic from this chapter.

### Method 1: For Loop Implementation

When you know the exact number of contacts to check, use a for loop:

```python-execute
# Contact search with for loop - known number of contacts
# Using a list (container for multiple items - details in Chapter 4)
contacts = ["Alice Smith", "Bob Wilson", "Sarah Johnson", "David Brown", "Emma Davis"]
target_name = "Sarah Johnson"

print(f"Searching for {target_name}...")
found = False

for i in range(len(contacts)):
    current_contact = contacts[i]
    position = i + 1

    print(f"Checking contact {position}: {current_contact}")

    if current_contact == target_name:
        print(f"Found {target_name} at position {position}!")
        print("Phone: (555) 345-6789")
        found = True
        break
    else:
        print("Not a match, continuing search...")

if not found:
    print(f"{target_name} not found in contact list.")
```

```note title="The break Statement"
The `break` statement immediately exits a loop when executed. In the contact search above, once we find the target contact, there's no need to check the remaining contacts, so we use `break` to stop the loop early and improve efficiency.
```

### Method 2: While Loop Implementation

When you want to search until the target is found, use a while loop:

```python-execute
# Contact search with while loop - search until found
contacts = ["Alice Smith", "Bob Wilson", "Sarah Johnson", "David Brown", "Emma Davis"]
target_name = "Sarah Johnson"

print(f"Searching for {target_name}...")
found = False
position = 0

while not found and position < len(contacts):
    current_contact = contacts[position]
    contact_number = position + 1

    print(f"Checking contact {contact_number}: {current_contact}")

    if current_contact == target_name:
        print(f"Found {target_name} at position {contact_number}!")
        print("Phone: (555) 345-6789")
        found = True
    else:
        print("Not a match, continuing search...")
        position += 1

if not found:
    print(f"{target_name} not found in contact list.")
```

## Choosing the Right Loop Type

Both implementations achieve the same result, but each has advantages:

**For loop approach:**
- Clear and straightforward when you know the list size
- Easy to track position in the list
- Natural fit for processing all items

**While loop approach:**
- More flexible - can stop as soon as target is found
- Natural fit for "search until found" logic
- Better for very large lists where early exit saves time

## Practice Exercises

```python-execute
# Contact counting example
print("Enter contact names (enter 'done' to finish):")
contact_count = 0

while True:
    name = input(f"Contact {contact_count + 1}: ")
    if name == "done":
        break
    contact_count += 1
    print(f"Added {name}")

print(f"Total contacts entered: {contact_count}")
```

id: loop_selection
question: "When implementing a contact search algorithm, which loop type is most appropriate?"
options:
  - id: a
    text: "Always use for loops"
    correct: false
    explanation: "While for loops work well, while loops better match the 'search until found' nature of the algorithm."
  - id: b
    text: "Always use while loops"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Both loop types can work, depending on how you structure the solution."
  - id: c
    text: "Use the loop type that best fits your approach: for loops when processing all items, while loops when searching until found"
    correct: true
    explanation: "Correct! Choose the loop type that most naturally expresses your algorithm's logic."
  - id: d
    text: "Loops aren't needed for search algorithms"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Loops are essential for implementing the repetitive checking required in search algorithms."
```

## Summary

You have successfully implemented the contact search algorithm using both for loops and while loops:

- **For loops** work well when you want to check all contacts systematically
- **While loops** naturally express "search until found" logic
- **Both approaches** solve the same problem using different strategies
- **Loop choice** depends on how you want to structure your solution

You can now transform algorithmic thinking into executable code using the fundamental programming concepts from this chapter.

**What's Next:** Chapter 4 introduces lists and collections, enabling you to work with larger datasets and implement more sophisticated algorithms.
