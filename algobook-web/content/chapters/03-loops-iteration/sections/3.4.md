# Practice and Review: Building with Loops

```note title="🎓 Your Loop Journey Culminates Here!"
You've learned the individual pieces—now it's time to put them together! This section will transform you from someone who knows loops into someone who **thinks in loops** and uses them to solve real-world problems.
```

## 🎯 What You'll Master Today

By the end of this section, you'll be able to:

✅ **Combine different loop types** to tackle complex, multi-step problems  
✅ **Choose the right loop** for each situation like a pro  
✅ **Apply loop patterns** to solve practical, real-world challenges  
✅ **Demonstrate true mastery** through hands-on coding exercises

## 🔧 Your Loop Toolkit: A Quick Review

You've learned two powerful types of loops, each with their own strengths. Now it's time to put them to work together, solving the kinds of real-world problems that make programming so exciting! 🚀

```hint title="💡 The Key to Loop Mastery"
The secret isn't just knowing how each loop works—it's knowing **when** to use each one. By the end of this section, this choice will become second nature!
```

Let's quickly review your loop arsenal:

### 🔢 For Loops: Your Precision Tool

**Perfect when:** You know exactly how many times to repeat

```python-execute
# Use for loops when you know exactly how many times to repeat
print("Countdown from 5:")
for i in range(5, 0, -1):
    print(f"{i}...")
print("Blast off! 🚀")
```

### ❓ While Loops: Your Flexible Friend

**Perfect when:** You repeat until a condition is met (unknown number of iterations)

```python-execute
# Use while loops when you repeat until a condition is met
print("Keep guessing until you get 7:")
import random
secret = 7
guess = 0

while guess != secret:
    guess = int(input("Your guess: "))
    if guess != secret:
        print("Try again!")
    else:
        print("Correct! 🎉")
```

```note title="✨ The Magic Moment"
Notice how each loop type has its **sweet spot**? For loops excel with known quantities, while loops handle uncertainty like champions. Now let's see the real magic—what happens when you combine them in the same program!
```

## 📊 Practice Challenges: Real-World Problem Solving

Ready to put your skills to the test? These challenges will show you how loops solve actual problems you might encounter as a programmer!

### 🎆 Challenge 1: Grade Calculator with Smart Validation

```note title="🎯 Challenge Focus"
**What you'll practice:** Combining loop types strategically  
**Real-world application:** Input validation and data processing  
**Key insight:** Using the right loop for each part of the problem
```

This challenge combines both loop types beautifully:
- 🔢 **For loop:** We know exactly how many students we have
- ❓ **While loop:** We don't know how many attempts it takes to get valid grades

```python-execute
# Grade Calculator - Practice combining loops
print("=== Class Grade Calculator ===")

# First, ask how many students (for loop will use this)
num_students = int(input("How many students? "))

total_points = 0
student_count = 0

# Use for loop since we know exact number of students
for student_num in range(1, num_students + 1):
    print(f"\nStudent {student_num}:")
    
    # Use while loop to keep asking until valid grade
    valid_grade = False
    while not valid_grade:
        grade = float(input("Enter grade (0-100): "))
        if 0 <= grade <= 100:
            valid_grade = True
            total_points += grade
            student_count += 1
        else:
            print("Grade must be between 0 and 100!")

# Calculate and display results
average = total_points / student_count
print(f"\nClass Results:")
print(f"Total students: {student_count}")
print(f"Class average: {average:.1f}")

if average >= 90:
    print("Excellent class performance! 🌟")
elif average >= 80:
    print("Good class performance! 👍")
elif average >= 70:
    print("Acceptable class performance.")
else:
    print("Class needs improvement.")
```

```hint title="🧠 Strategic Loop Combination"
**The winning strategy:**

✅ **Outer for loop** → handles the **known quantity** (number of students)  
✅ **Inner while loop** → handles the **unknown quantity** (validation attempts)  

**Why this works so well:**
- 🎯 Each loop does what it's best at
- 🔄 Clean separation of concerns
- 💪 Robust and professional-quality code

This pattern appears constantly in real programming!
```

## Practice Challenge 2: Pattern Maker with Nested Loops

Nested loops (loops inside loops) are perfect for creating patterns. The outer loop typically controls rows, and the inner loop controls what appears in each row:

```python-execute
# Number Pattern Maker - Practice nested loops
print("=== Number Pattern Maker ===")

rows = int(input("How many rows for the pattern? "))

# Pattern 1: Number triangle
print("\nPattern 1 - Number Triangle:")
for row in range(1, rows + 1):
    for num in range(1, row + 1):
        print(num, end=" ")
    print()  # New line after each row

# Pattern 2: Star rectangle  
print(f"\nPattern 2 - Star Rectangle ({rows} x {rows}):")
for row in range(rows):
    for col in range(rows):
        print("*", end=" ")
    print()  # New line after each row
```

```note title="Pattern Building Logic 📐"
**See the beautiful logic?**

➡️ Row 1 has **1 number**  
➡️ Row 2 has **2 numbers**  
➡️ Row 3 has **3 numbers**  

**The key insight:** The outer loop (row number) determines how many times the inner loop (numbers) should run!

🎯 **This pattern is everywhere:** tables, grids, game boards, pixel art!
```

### 🧮 Challenge 3: Interactive Calculator Menu

```note title="🎯 Challenge Focus"
**What you'll practice:** While loops for user-driven programs  
**Real-world application:** Menu systems, interactive applications, user interfaces  
**Key insight:** How to keep programs running until the user decides to quit
```

This example showcases while loops perfectly! We don't know how many calculations the user wants to do, but we keep the program running until they choose to quit:

```python-execute
# Simple Calculator Menu - Practice while loops and decision making
print("=== Simple Calculator ===")

running = True
while running:
    print("\nOptions:")
    print("1. Add two numbers")
    print("2. Subtract two numbers") 
    print("3. Multiply two numbers")
    print("4. Quit")
    
    choice = input("Choose option (1-4): ")
    
    if choice == "1":
        num1 = float(input("First number: "))
        num2 = float(input("Second number: "))
        result = num1 + num2
        print(f"Result: {num1} + {num2} = {result}")
        
    elif choice == "2":
        num1 = float(input("First number: "))
        num2 = float(input("Second number: "))
        result = num1 - num2
        print(f"Result: {num1} - {num2} = {result}")
        
    elif choice == "3":
        num1 = float(input("First number: "))
        num2 = float(input("Second number: "))
        result = num1 * num2
        print(f"Result: {num1} × {num2} = {result}")
        
    elif choice == "4":
        print("Thanks for using the calculator!")
        running = False
        
    else:
        print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")
```

```note title="🍽️ Menu-Driven Programs"
This is a classic **menu-driven program structure**—you'll see this pattern everywhere in professional software!

**Why this works so well:**

✅ **User controls the flow** → program runs until they choose to quit  
🔄 **Always responsive** → handles user input gracefully  
📝 **Clean structure** → easy to read and maintain  
🔧 **Easily extensible** → simple to add new menu options  

**Real-world examples:** ATM machines, restaurant ordering systems, game menus, admin dashboards
```

## 🎯 Your Turn: Independent Practice

```note title="💪 Time to Level Up!"
You've seen loops in action—now it's time to **write them yourself**! These exercises will transform you from observer to creator. Each one is designed to build your **loop intuition** and problem-solving confidence.
```

**Remember:** The struggle is where the magic happens! ✨ Don't peek at the solutions right away—work through the logic, make mistakes, and learn from them. That's how you build real programming skills!
