# Practice: Algorithm Efficiency Analysis

Chapter 7 developed a comprehensive toolkit for algorithm efficiency analysis: performance measurement (Section 7.2), Big O notation (Section 7.3), and recurrence relations (Section 7.4). Section 7.5 provides practice problems and assessment exercises to consolidate these analytical techniques.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will:
- Apply timing, Big O analysis, and recurrence relations systematically
- Analyze complex algorithms using multiple complementary techniques
- Make informed algorithmic decisions based on comprehensive analysis
- Demonstrate mastery of algorithm efficiency analysis

## Integration Summary

**Three Complementary Techniques:**
- **Performance Measurement**: Reveals actual execution behavior and constant factors
- **Big O Analysis**: Predicts asymptotic scaling behavior for large inputs
- **Recurrence Relations**: Provides mathematical framework for recursive algorithm analysis

**When to Use Each:**
- **Start with Big O** to understand theoretical complexity
- **Use timing** to validate predictions and assess practical performance
- **Apply recurrence analysis** for recursive algorithms requiring systematic mathematical treatment
