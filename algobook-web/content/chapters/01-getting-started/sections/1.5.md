# From Algorithms to Programs

We have built a foundation for understanding computation: algorithmic thinking (Section 1.2), binary representation (Section 1.3), and data types (Section 1.4). But a crucial question remains: **how do our step-by-step algorithms actually become running programs?**

This section reveals the bridge between human problem-solving and machine execution. We'll see how algorithms become instructions, how these instructions execute, and how programming languages make this process practical.

## The Translation Challenge

Consider our familiar algorithmic approach from Section 1.2:

```note title="Algorithm: Add Two Numbers"
1. Get first number from user
2. Get second number from user
3. Add the numbers together
4. Display the result
```

We understand that computers manipulate bit patterns (Section 1.3) and interpret them as different data types (Section 1.4). But how does our four-step algorithm become the specific bit manipulations that hardware can execute?

The computer doesn't understand "get number from user" or "add numbers together." It only understands very simple operations performed one at a time.

## Instructions: Atomic Operations

The key insight is that every algorithm, no matter how complex, breaks down into a sequence of elementary operations called **instructions**. Each instruction tells the computer to perform one simple action:

**Load**: Move data from memory into the processor
- "Load the number stored at location A"
- "Load the value that the user just typed"

**Store**: Move data from the processor to memory
- "Store this result at location C"
- "Store this value where it can be displayed"

**Calculate**: Perform arithmetic using the operations from Section 1.4
- "Add these two values"
- "Compare these two numbers"

**Jump**: Change which instruction to execute next
- "If the result is zero, jump to instruction 50"
- "Jump back to instruction 10"

Our simple algorithm becomes a sequence of these atomic operations:

> **Human step**: "Get first number from user"
>
> **Instructions**: Load from input → Store at location A

> **Human step**: "Add the numbers together"
>
> **Instructions**: Load from A → Load from B → Add values → Store at C

Every step in our algorithm expands into multiple simple instructions that the hardware can execute directly.

## Programs: Instructions in Memory

A **program** is an ordered list of these instructions stored in memory as bit patterns. Here's the key insight that makes modern computing possible:

**Programs and data are stored together in the same memory, both as bit patterns.**

This means:
- Instructions like "add two numbers" are bit patterns stored at memory addresses 1000, 1001, 1002...
- Data like the actual numbers are bit patterns stored at addresses 2000, 2001, 2002...
- The hardware treats them identically as memory contents
- Only the context determines whether a bit pattern is interpreted as an instruction or as data

This **stored-program architecture** enables the flexibility of modern computers. The same hardware can run any program simply by loading different bit patterns into memory.

## Execution: Bringing Programs to Life

The computer executes programs through a simple cycle:

1. **Read** the next instruction from memory
2. **Interpret** what operation it specifies
3. **Perform** that operation
4. **Repeat** with the next instruction

A special register called the **program counter** keeps track of which instruction to execute next. Normally it advances through instructions in sequence (1000, 1001, 1002...), but jump instructions can change it to implement loops and conditionals from our algorithmic thinking.

This simple pattern—executing one instruction at a time—creates all computational complexity. Whether running a web browser or processing scientific data, the computer is always just reading and executing simple instructions in sequence.

## Programming Languages: The Practical Bridge

Writing programs as binary instruction patterns would be nearly impossible. Consider having to write `10110001 01001100 10110010` instead of "get a number from the user and store it." Programming languages solve this challenge by providing human-readable notation that automated translators convert to machine instructions.

The gap between human thinking and machine execution is vast. Our algorithmic step "add two numbers together" must become a precise sequence like:
1. Load value from memory location A into processor register
2. Load value from memory location B into processor register
3. Perform binary addition using arithmetic logic unit
4. Store result from processor register to memory location C

Writing these detailed instructions manually for every algorithm would be impossibly tedious and error-prone. We need a systematic way to express our problem-solving intentions in forms that can be automatically converted to machine instructions.

Programming languages provide this solution through automated conversion tools called **translators**. These translator programs are technically known as **compilers** and **interpreters**—sophisticated programs that read human-written code and generate the corresponding instruction sequences. These translators handle all the mechanical details: determining memory locations, generating proper load and store sequences, implementing arithmetic operations, and managing program flow.

When we write code expressing our algorithmic thinking—getting input, performing calculations, producing output—the translator systematically converts each statement into the atomic operations that hardware can execute. The same logical structure we developed in our step-by-step algorithm becomes a sequence of load, store, calculate, and jump instructions.

Different programming languages operate at different distances from machine instructions. Some languages stay close to hardware operations, requiring programmers to explicitly manage memory locations and instruction sequences. Others provide higher-level abstractions that let programmers think in terms of mathematical operations, text processing, or data manipulation without considering the underlying bit patterns.

Regardless of abstraction level, all programming languages ultimately translate to the same fundamental instruction types. The difference lies in how much detail the language handles automatically versus requiring explicit programmer specification. Higher-level languages hide more mechanical complexity, while lower-level languages provide more direct control over hardware resources.

Programming languages serve as bridges between two worlds: human problem-solving approaches and machine execution capabilities. They preserve the logical structure of our algorithms while translating them into forms that hardware can process systematically. This translation process is what makes general-purpose computing possible. The same hardware can solve countless different problems simply by loading different instruction sequences—all generated by translators from human-readable code expressing different algorithmic approaches.

## The Complete Picture and What You Now Understand

We can now trace the complete journey from human problem-solving to machine execution:

1. **Human thinking**: Create step-by-step algorithm using logical reasoning
2. **Programming language**: Express algorithm in human-readable code
3. **Translation**: Automated tools convert code to instruction sequences
4. **Execution**: Hardware reads instructions and manipulates bit patterns
5. **Results**: Information meaningful to humans emerges

The computer transforms our algorithmic thinking into systematic bit manipulation through layers of translation, enabling machines to execute human problem-solving approaches.

With this understanding, you're ready to begin programming. You now know that when you write code in any programming language:

**Variables** store bit patterns at memory locations but give them human-friendly names, abstracting away the need to remember specific memory addresses.

**Operations** translate into sequences of load, calculate, and store instructions that manipulate bit patterns using the arithmetic operations we studied in Section 1.4.

**Input and output** functions handle the conversion between human-readable forms and the internal bit pattern representations that programs actually process.

**Control structures** like conditionals and loops translate into jump instructions that modify execution flow, implementing the logical decision-making we design into our algorithms.

The programming language translator handles all the mechanical conversion complexity, allowing you to focus on expressing your problem-solving approach clearly. But you now understand the fundamental relationship between your high-level algorithmic thinking and the elementary computational processes that actually execute your solutions.
