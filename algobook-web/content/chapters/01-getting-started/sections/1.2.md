# Python Basics: Your First Code

Now that you understand algorithmic thinking, it's time to learn how to express your algorithms in Python! This is where the magic happens - where your problem-solving ideas become instructions that computers can follow.

## Why Python? The Perfect Starting Language

Before diving into code, let's understand what we're doing. In the previous section, you learned to think algorithmically - breaking problems into clear, logical steps. That's the hard part! Learning Python syntax is easier because you're just learning new vocabulary to express thoughts you already know how to think.

```note title="Why Python is Beginner-Friendly"
Python is designed to be readable and easy to learn. Unlike some programming languages written in cryptic symbols and abbreviations, Python code often reads almost like English. This makes it perfect for beginners because you can focus on programming concepts without getting bogged down in complex syntax.
```

Think of it this way: you already communicate complex ideas fluently in human language. Now you're learning a second language - one that computers understand. Like learning any language, it starts with simple words and phrases, then builds to more complex expressions.

The beautiful thing about programming: once you learn fundamental concepts in one language like Python, learning other languages becomes much easier. The core ideas - variables, loops, conditionals, functions - are universal. Only the vocabulary changes.

## 👋 Your Very First Python Program

Let's start with the simplest possible program - making the computer say "Hello, World!" You might wonder why we're starting with such a simple example. There's a wonderful tradition behind this: nearly every programmer in history has started their journey with some version of a "Hello, World!" program.

This tradition exists because this simple program demonstrates the most fundamental capability of any programming language: producing output. It's like testing your voice before giving a speech. Once you can make the computer display text, you know your development environment works and you're ready to build more complex programs.

```python-execute
print("Hello, World!")
```

Congratulations! You just wrote and executed your first Python program. Take a moment to appreciate what happened: you gave an instruction to a computer, and it followed that instruction exactly. That's the essence of programming.

The `print()` function tells the computer to display whatever text you put inside the parentheses and quotes. Think of `print()` as making the computer "speak" - whatever you put inside gets announced to the user. This will be one of your most useful tools for showing results to users and debugging programs by seeing what's happening inside them.

```note
The `print()` function is like a megaphone for your program - whatever you put inside will be announced to the user.
```

## Making Programs Personal

Let's make this more interesting and create a more engaging interaction. One exciting thing about programming: even with simple tools, you can create programs that feel personal and interactive.

```python-execute
print("Hello! Welcome to programming.")
print("My name is Python Bot.")
print("I'm here to help you learn!")
print("Programming is going to be fun!")
```

Notice what's happening: each `print()` statement creates a new line of output, and when you run the program, it feels like the computer is conversing with you. This demonstrates an important concept: even simple programs can create engaging user experiences.

You can have as many `print()` statements as you want! Each executes in order, from top to bottom. This sequential execution is fundamental to how programs work - the computer reads your instructions line by line and follows them one at a time, like following a recipe.

This is your first glimpse into how programs can have personality. The same technical functionality (displaying text) can feel completely different depending on what text you choose and how you organize it.

## 📝 Working with Text and Numbers

Now let's explore something fundamental about how computers understand and work with information. Just like humans categorize information differently in our minds (is something a word, a number, a date, a color?), computers also categorize data into different types. Understanding these data types is crucial because it affects how computers process and manipulate information.

The two most basic and important data types you'll work with are text (called "strings" in programming) and numbers. Learning to work with these effectively is like learning the alphabet before writing words - they're building blocks of almost everything you'll create.

Let's explore these two fundamental types and understand how Python handles each one:

### Text (Strings)
Text in programming is called a "string" - think of it as characters threaded together like beads on a necklace. This is one programming term that makes perfect sense once you hear the explanation!

The crucial rule: strings must always be surrounded by quotes. This is how Python knows you're talking about text rather than a command or variable name. Without quotes, Python would try to interpret your text as programming instructions, causing errors.

```python-execute
print("This is a string")
print("Strings can contain numbers like 123")
print("They can have symbols like @#$%!")
print('Single quotes work too')
```

Notice that strings can contain anything: letters, numbers, symbols, spaces, even emojis! What makes something a string isn't what it contains, but that it's wrapped in quotes. Even if a string contains numbers like "123", Python treats it as text, not as a mathematical number.

You can use either double quotes ("") or single quotes ('') - Python treats them the same way. Many programmers choose one style and stick with it for consistency, though having both options is useful (like when you need to include a quote mark inside your string).

### Numbers
Numbers are fundamentally different from strings in how Python handles them. When you write a number without quotes, Python recognizes it as a mathematical value for calculations, comparisons, and other mathematical operations.

```python-execute
print("Here are some numbers:")
print(42)
print(3.14159)
print(100)
print(-25)
```

Notice that we don't put quotes around numbers. This is crucial! The moment you put quotes around a number, like "42", it becomes a string (text) rather than a number. As text, you can't perform mathematical operations on it.

```note title="Python Number Types"
Python handles several types of numbers:
* **Integers** (whole numbers): 42, -17, 0
* **Floats** (decimal numbers): 3.14159, -2.5, 0.0
```

The distinction between strings and numbers might seem academic now, but it becomes critically important when getting input from users or performing calculations. Understanding this difference will save you from many common beginner mistakes.

```quiz
id: string-vs-number
question: "What happens when you run this Python code: print('5' + '3')"
options:
  - id: a
    text: "8"
    correct: false
    explanation: This would be the result if they were numbers, but the quotes make them strings.
  - id: b
    text: "'53'"
    correct: true
    explanation: Correct! When you 'add' strings, Python joins them together (concatenation). '5' + '3' becomes '53'.
  - id: c
    text: "An error message"
    correct: false
    explanation: Python can add strings together - it just joins them rather than doing math.
  - id: d
    text: "5.3"
    correct: false
    explanation: This isn't how Python handles string operations.
```

This difference between strings and numbers is so important that it's worth seeing another example:

```python-execute
print("String addition:", "5" + "3")
print("Number addition:", 5 + 3)
print("String with space:", "5" + " " + "3")
print("Mixed operations don't work:")
# This next line would cause an error if uncommented:
# print(5 + "3")  # Error! Can't add number to string
```

## Python as a Calculator

One of Python's great strengths is effortless mathematical calculations. In fact, you can think of Python as a powerful calculator that also handles text, makes decisions, and automates repetitive tasks.

This mathematical capability makes programming powerful for solving real-world problems. Need to calculate compound interest? Python does it instantly. Want to find the average of a thousand test scores? Python handles it easily. Need to convert temperatures or distances? Python's got you covered.

Let's explore the basic mathematical operations that Python provides:

```python-execute
print("Addition:", 5 + 3)
print("Subtraction:", 10 - 4)
print("Multiplication:", 7 * 6)
print("Division:", 15 / 3)
print("Division (no decimals):", 17 // 5)
print("Remainder:", 17 % 5)
print("Power:", 2 ** 3)
```

```hint title="Math Operator Reference"
- `+` addition
- `-` subtraction  
- `*` multiplication
- `/` division (with decimals)
- `//` division (whole numbers only)
- `%` remainder (modulo)
- `**` power (exponent)
```

Let's see these math operators in action with a practical calculation:

```python-execute
print("Birthday Party Planning")
print("Calculating party supplies...")
print("We have", 15, "guests coming")
print("Pizzas needed (1 per 3 people):", 15 // 3)
print("Leftover people needing extra snacks:", 15 % 3)
print("Each pizza costs $12")
print("Total pizza cost:", (15 // 3) * 12)
```

---

## Variables: Storing Information

Now we come to one of the most important concepts in all of programming: variables. This might be the single most powerful tool you'll learn in this entire course, because variables allow you to write programs that can work with different data, remember information, and adapt to different situations.

Think of variables as labeled boxes where we can put information. But they're more than just storage - they're what allow your programs to be flexible and dynamic instead of just repeating the same fixed actions every time.

Here's why variables are so powerful: instead of writing a program that can only calculate the area of a circle with radius 5, you can write a program that calculates the area of a circle with any radius. Instead of a program that greets "John," you can write a program that greets any person. Variables are what make the difference between rigid, limited programs and flexible, useful ones.

Let's see how they work. Notice the lines starting with `#` - these are comments that explain what the code does. Python ignores comments when running the program, but they help humans understand the code:

```python-execute
# Creating variables - like putting data in labeled boxes
name = "Alex"
age = 16
height = 5.8
favorite_number = 42

print("Name:", name)
print("Age:", age)
print("Height:", height, "feet") 
print("Favorite number:", favorite_number)
```

The equals sign `=` in Python means "store the value on the right in the variable on the left." It's not testing if they're equal - it's putting something in the box.

```warning
Don't confuse the assignment operator `=` with mathematical equality. In Python, `age = 16` means "store the value 16 in the variable named age."
```

### Variable Naming Rules

Python has specific rules for naming variables:

**Good variable names:**
```python-execute
student_name = "Maria"
test_score = 95
player_health = 100
level_2_completed = True

print("Student:", student_name)
print("Score:", test_score)
print("Health:", player_health)
print("Level 2 done:", level_2_completed)
```

**Variable names that won't work:**
```python
# These will cause errors:
1name = "Bob"        # Can't start with a number
my-score = 95        # Can't use dashes  
first name = "Alice" # Can't have spaces
```

```hint title="Variable Naming Best Practices"
* Use descriptive names: `score` not `s`
* Use underscores for spaces: `first_name` not `firstname`
* Start with lowercase letters
* Make it clear what the variable stores
```

Let's test your understanding of variable naming rules:

```quiz
id: variable-naming
question: "Which of these is a valid Python variable name?"
options:
  - id: a
    text: "2_cats"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Variable names cannot start with a number."
  - id: b
    text: "my-age"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Variable names cannot contain dashes. Use underscores instead."
  - id: c
    text: "student_grade"
    correct: true
    explanation: "Perfect! This follows all the rules: starts with a letter, uses underscores instead of spaces, and is descriptive."
  - id: d
    text: "first name"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Variable names cannot contain spaces. Use \"first_name\" instead."
```

## Using Variables in Calculations

The real power of variables comes when we use them in calculations. But first, let's learn a powerful way to display variables in our output.

### F-Strings: Professional Output Formatting

Python has a special way to include variables directly inside strings called **f-strings**. Instead of using multiple print statements or complex concatenation, you can put variables right inside your text:

```python-execute
# F-string example
name = "Sarah"
age = 17
grade = 95.5

# Old way (works but not as clean):
print("Student:", name, "Age:", age, "Grade:", grade)

# New way with f-strings (much better!):
print(f"Student: {name}")
print(f"Age: {age} years old")
print(f"Grade: {grade}%")
print(f"{name} is {age} years old and scored {grade}%")
```

F-strings work by putting an `f` before the quotes and using `{}` around variable names. Python automatically replaces `{name}` with the value stored in the `name` variable.

```hint title="F-String Number Formatting"
Sometimes numbers need to look neat. F-strings let you control this with a systematic pattern.

**Understanding the Pattern:**
The format pattern is: `{variable:m.nf}` where:
- **m** = minimum width (optional - how many total characters)
- **n** = precision (how many digits after the decimal)  
- **f** = format type (f = float/decimal number)

**Examples:**
- `{number:.2f}` → 123.46 (2 decimal places)
- `{number:.1f}` → 123.5 (1 decimal place)
- `{number:.0f}` → 123 (no decimals, rounds)
- `{number:8.2f}` → " 123.46" (8 characters wide, 2 decimals)

**For money:** Always use `.2f` to show exactly 2 decimal places like $1.04
```

Now let's see f-strings in action with a practical calculation:

```python-execute
# Store information in variables
pizza_price = 12.99
tax_rate = 0.08
tip_rate = 0.15

# Calculate costs
subtotal = pizza_price
tax = subtotal * tax_rate
tip = subtotal * tip_rate
total = subtotal + tax + tip

# Display the results
print(f"Pizza Price: ${pizza_price:.2f}")
print(f"Tax: ${tax:.2f}")
print(f"Tip: ${tip:.2f}")
print(f"Total: ${total:.2f}")
```

## Getting Input from Users

So far, we've been putting values directly in our code. But what if we want users to provide information? We use the `input()` function:

```python-execute
print("What's your name?")
user_name = input()
print("Nice to meet you,", user_name + "!")
```

The `input()` function waits for the user to type something and press Enter, then stores what they typed in a variable.

### Making Programs Interactive

Let's create a program that gets to know the user:

```python-execute
print("Let's get to know each other!")
print("What's your name?")
name = input()

print("Hi " + name + "! What's your favorite color?")
color = input()

print("Great choice! " + color + " is a beautiful color.")
print("Nice talking with you, " + name + "!")
```

## Working with Numbers from Input

There's one important thing about `input()`: it always gives us text (a string), even if the user types a number. To do math with user input, we need to convert it:

```python-execute
print("Age Calculator")
print("What's your current age?")
current_age_text = input()  # This is text like "16"
current_age = int(current_age_text)  # Convert to number 16

next_year = current_age + 1
print("Next year you'll be", next_year, "years old!")
```

We can make this shorter by combining the steps:

```python-execute
print("Simple Calculator")
print("Enter your first number:")
num1 = int(input())
print("Enter your second number:")
num2 = int(input())

result = num1 + num2
print(num1, "+", num2, "=", result)
```

```danger title="Common Beginner Mistake"
If you forget to convert text to numbers with `int()`, you might get unexpected results:
- `"5" + "3"` gives `"53"` (joining text)
- `5 + 3` gives `8` (adding numbers)

Always use `int(input())` when you need numbers for math!
```

---

```quiz
id: f-string-practice
question: "Which f-string correctly displays 'Hello, Sarah! You are 17 years old.' if name='Sarah' and age=17?"
options:
  - id: a
    text: "print('Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.')"
    correct: false
    explanation: Missing the 'f' before the string - this won't substitute the variables.
  - id: b
    text: "print(f'Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.')"
    correct: true
    explanation: Perfect! The 'f' before the string tells Python to substitute variables inside {}.
  - id: c
    text: "print(f'Hello, name! You are age years old.')"
    correct: false
    explanation: Variables need to be inside {} brackets to be substituted.
  - id: d
    text: "print(f'Hello, [name]! You are [age] years old.')"
    correct: false
    explanation: F-strings use {} brackets, not [] brackets for variables.
```

## Putting It All Together: Complete Programs

Let's combine everything we've learned into complete, useful programs:

### Program 1: Personal Information Display

```python-execute
# Personal Information Program
print("=== Personal Information ===")

# Get information from user
print("Please enter your first name:")
first_name = input()

print("Please enter your last name:")
last_name = input()

print("Please enter your age:")
age = int(input())

print("Please enter your favorite subject:")
subject = input()

# Process the information
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name
birth_year = 2024 - age  # Approximate birth year

# Display the results
print("\n=== Your Information ===")
print(f"Full name: {full_name}")
print(f"Age: {age} years old")
print(f"Birth year: approximately {birth_year}")
print(f"Favorite subject: {subject}")
print(f"Thanks for sharing, {first_name}!")
```

### Program 2: Restaurant Bill Calculator

```python-execute
# Restaurant Bill Calculator
print("=== Restaurant Bill Calculator ===")

# Get the bill information
print("Enter the meal cost (without tip):")
meal_cost = float(input())  # Use float for decimal numbers

print("Enter tip percentage (like 15 for 15%):")
tip_percent = float(input())

# Calculate the amounts
tip_amount = meal_cost * (tip_percent / 100)
total_bill = meal_cost + tip_amount

# Display the results
print(f"\nMeal cost: ${meal_cost:.2f}")
print(f"Tip ({tip_percent}%): ${tip_amount:.2f}")
print(f"Total bill: ${total_bill:.2f}")
```

```note title="New Concept: float()"
We use `float()` instead of `int()` when we need to work with decimal numbers like prices or percentages. The `:.2f` formatting ensures money amounts always show exactly 2 decimal places.
```

### Program 3: Grade Calculator

```python-execute
# Grade Calculator
print("=== Grade Calculator ===")

# Get the scores
print("Enter your homework score (0-100):")
homework = int(input())

print("Enter your midterm score (0-100):")
midterm = int(input())

print("Enter your final exam score (0-100):")
final = int(input())

# Calculate weighted average
# Homework: 30%, Midterm: 30%, Final: 40%
final_grade = (homework * 0.3) + (midterm * 0.3) + (final * 0.4)

# Display result
print(f"\nHomework: {homework}")
print(f"Midterm: {midterm}")
print(f"Final: {final}")
print(f"Final Grade: {final_grade:.1f}")

# Give feedback based on grade
if final_grade >= 90:
    print("Excellent work! That's an A!")
elif final_grade >= 80:
    print("Good job! That's a B!")
else:
    print("Keep working hard!")
```

## 💻 Practice Problems

options:
  - id: a
    text: To make the program run faster
    correct: false
    explanation: The conversion doesn't affect speed significantly.
  - id: b
    text: Because input() always gives us text, and we need to convert it to a number to do math
    correct: true
    explanation: Perfect! input() always returns text (string), so we convert it to int for mathematical operations.
  - id: c
    text: To make the code look more professional
    correct: false
    explanation: While good practices matter, this conversion serves a functional purpose.
  - id: d
    text: It's not necessary, just a preference
    correct: false
    explanation: It's absolutely necessary if you want to do math with the input!
```

## Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

### Mistake 1: Forgetting Quotes Around Text
```python
# Wrong - Python thinks name is a variable
print(Hello)  # Error!

# Right - Python knows this is text
print("Hello")
```

### Mistake 2: Not Converting Input for Math
```python
# Wrong - will cause error
age = input("Your age: ")
next_year = age + 1  # Error! Can't add number to text

# Right - convert text to number first  
age = int(input("Your age: "))
next_year = age + 1  # Works!
```

### Mistake 3: Forgetting Variable Assignment Direction
```python
# Wrong - you can't assign to a literal number
16 = age  # Error!

# Right - assign value to variable
age = 16  # Works!
```

## What We've Learned

In this section, you've mastered fundamental Python programming tools:

1. **print()** - Displaying text and numbers
2. **Variables** - Storing information with descriptive names  
3. **input()** - Getting information from users
4. **Data types** - Text (strings) and numbers (integers/floats)
5. **Type conversion** - Converting between text and numbers
6. **Mathematical operations** - Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
7. **F-strings** - Professional-looking output formatting

These are building blocks of every Python program. With these tools, you can create interactive programs that get input, process it, and produce useful output.

## Looking Ahead

Now that you know how to store information in variables and get input from users, you're ready to build more sophisticated programs. In the next section, we'll learn how to combine these basics into complete, well-structured programs and how to test and debug code when things don't work as expected.

The foundation you've built is solid - every Python program uses variables, input, output, and basic operations. You're well on your way to becoming a programmer!
