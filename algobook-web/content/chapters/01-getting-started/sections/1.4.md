# Practice and Review

Now that you can think algorithmically, use Python's basic tools, and write sequential programs, let's practice these skills with complete problems. This section helps you apply everything you've learned so far.

**Learning Objectives:**
- Apply algorithmic thinking to new problems
- Write complete sequential programs using input-process-output pattern
- Practice using variables, calculations, and formatted output
- Verify understanding of fundamental concepts

## What You've Learned

This chapter gave you the foundation for programming:

**Key Skills:**

1. **Algorithmic Thinking**
   Breaking problems into step-by-step solutions using input-process-output patterns.

2. **Python Building Blocks**
   Variables, data types (strings, integers, floats), mathematical operations, input/output, and f-string formatting.

3. **Sequential Programming**
   Writing programs that execute one line at a time to implement complete algorithms.

These skills prepare you for the next chapter, which introduces decision-making in programs.

### Quick Review

Let's check your understanding of the key concepts:

```quiz
id: algorithmic-thinking-review
question: "What is the foundation of programming?"
options:
  - id: a
    text: Memorizing Python syntax
    correct: false
    explanation: Syntax is a tool, but thinking through problems step-by-step is the foundation.
  - id: b
    text: Breaking problems down into step-by-step solutions
    correct: true
    explanation: Correct! Algorithmic thinking - solving problems systematically - is what makes programming possible.
  - id: c
    text: Using many variables
    correct: false
    explanation: Variables are useful tools, but systematic thinking is the foundation.
  - id: d
    text: Writing complex programs
    correct: false
    explanation: Simple, clear solutions are better than complex ones.
```

```quiz
id: program-structure-review
question: "What pattern do sequential programs follow?"
options:
  - id: a
    text: Output, Input, Process
    correct: false
    explanation: The order matters - you need input before you can process it.
  - id: b
    text: Input, Process, Output
    correct: true
    explanation: Correct! Get data, transform it, then show results.
  - id: c
    text: Process, Input, Output
    correct: false
    explanation: You need input data before you can process it.
  - id: d
    text: Any order works
    correct: false
    explanation: The order matters - logical sequence is important.
```

```quiz
id: error-types-review
question: "If your program runs without crashing but gives the wrong answer, what type of error is this?"
options:
  - id: a
    text: Syntax error
    correct: false
    explanation: Syntax errors prevent programs from running at all.
  - id: b
    text: Runtime error
    correct: false
    explanation: Runtime errors cause programs to crash while running.
  - id: c
    text: Logic error
    correct: true
    explanation: Correct! Logic errors produce wrong results without crashing - they're the hardest to find.
  - id: d
    text: No error
    correct: false
    explanation: If the results are wrong, there's definitely an error that needs fixing.
```

## Practical Application

### Programming Challenges

Now demonstrate your skills with these comprehensive coding exercises. Each problem tests multiple concepts from Chapter 1:

```exercise
id: height-converter
title: Height Converter (Inches to Feet and Inches)
description: Convert a total height in inches to feet and remaining inches.
difficulty: easy
echoInput: true
starterCode: |
  # Height Converter
  # Convert total inches to feet and remaining inches
  # Remember: 12 inches = 1 foot
  
  print("=== Height Converter ===")
  
  # Your task: Create a program that converts total inches to feet and remaining inches
  # Remember: 1 foot = 12 inches
  
  # Write your complete program here:
testCases:
  - input: "65\n"

      Enter height in inches: 65
      65 inches = 5 feet 5 inches
    hidden: false
  - input: "72\n"
    expectedOutput: |
      === Height Converter ===
      Enter height in inches: 72
      72 inches = 6 feet 0 inches
    hidden: true
  - input: "58\n"
    expectedOutput: |
      === Height Converter ===
      Enter height in inches: 58
      58 inches = 4 feet 10 inches
    hidden: true
  - input: "11\n"
    expectedOutput: |
      === Height Converter ===
      Enter height in inches: 11
      11 inches = 0 feet 11 inches
    hidden: true
  - input: "24\n"
    expectedOutput: |
      === Height Converter ===
      Enter height in inches: 24
      24 inches = 2 feet 0 inches
    hidden: true
  - input: "36\n"
    expectedOutput: |
      === Height Converter ===
      Enter height in inches: 36
      36 inches = 3 feet 0 inches
    hidden: true
  - input: "1\n"
    expectedOutput: |
      === Height Converter ===
      Enter height in inches: 1
      1 inches = 0 feet 1 inches
    hidden: true
  - input: "12\n"
    expectedOutput: |
      === Height Converter ===
      Enter height in inches: 12
      12 inches = 1 feet 0 inches
    hidden: true
  - input: "100\n"
    expectedOutput: |
      === Height Converter ===
      Enter height in inches: 100
      100 inches = 8 feet 4 inches
    hidden: true
  - input: "77\n"
    expectedOutput: |
      === Height Converter ===
      Enter height in inches: 77
      77 inches = 6 feet 5 inches
    hidden: true
hints:
  - "Use int(input()) since we're working with whole inches"
  - "Use // for integer division: feet = inches // 12"
  - "Use % for remainder (modulo): remaining_inches = inches % 12"
  - 'Format: f"{inches} inches = {feet} feet {remaining_inches} inches"'
solution: |
  print("=== Height Converter ===")
  inches = int(input("Enter height in inches: "))
  feet = inches // 12
  remaining_inches = inches % 12
  print(f"{inches} inches = {feet} feet {remaining_inches} inches")
```
