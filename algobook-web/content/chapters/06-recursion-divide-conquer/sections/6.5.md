## Diverse Recursive Problems

### 1. String Processing: Palindrome Checking

A **palindrome** reads the same forwards and backwards. This problem has natural recursive structure:

```python-execute
def is_palindrome_recursive(s):
    # BASE CASE: empty string or single character
    if len(s) <= 1:
        return True
    
    # RECURSIVE CASE: check first and last characters
    if s[0] != s[-1]:
        return False
    
    # If first and last match, check the middle part
    return is_palindrome_recursive(s[1:-1])

# Test palindrome checking
test_words = ["racecar", "hello", "madam", "python", "a", ""]
for word in test_words:
    result = is_palindrome_recursive(word)
    print(f"'{word}' is palindrome: {result}")
```

### 2. List Processing: Recursive Sum and Operations

```python-execute
def recursive_sum(numbers):
    # BASE CASE: empty list
    if not numbers:
        return 0
    
    # RECURSIVE CASE: first element + sum of rest
    return numbers[0] + recursive_sum(numbers[1:])

def recursive_max(numbers):
    # BASE CASE: single element
    if len(numbers) == 1:
        return numbers[0]
    
    # RECURSIVE CASE: max of first element and max of rest
    rest_max = recursive_max(numbers[1:])
    return max(numbers[0], rest_max)

def count_occurrences(numbers, target):
    # BASE CASE: empty list
    if not numbers:
        return 0
    
    # RECURSIVE CASE: count current + count in rest
    current_count = 1 if numbers[0] == target else 0
    return current_count + count_occurrences(numbers[1:], target)

# Test list processing
test_list = [3, 7, 2, 7, 1, 7, 4]
print(f"List: {test_list}")
print(f"Recursive sum: {recursive_sum(test_list)}")
print(f"Recursive max: {recursive_max(test_list)}")
print(f"Count of 7: {count_occurrences(test_list, 7)}")
```

### 3. Pattern Generation: Recursive Drawing

```python-execute
def print_triangle(n, current_row=1):
    # BASE CASE: printed all rows
    if current_row > n:
        return
    
    # Print current row: spaces + stars
    spaces = " " * (n - current_row)
    stars = "*" * (2 * current_row - 1)
    print(spaces + stars)
    
    # RECURSIVE CASE: print next row
    print_triangle(n, current_row + 1)

def print_diamond(n, current=1, going_up=True):
    # BASE CASE: finished printing
    if current > n:
        return
    
    # Print current row with proper spacing for diamond shape
    spaces = " " * (n - current)
    stars = "*" * (2 * current - 1)
    print(spaces + stars)
    
    if going_up and current == n:
        # Reached the top, start going down
        print_diamond(n, current - 1, False)
    elif going_up:
        # Still going up
        print_diamond(n, current + 1, True)
    elif current > 1:
        # Going down
        print_diamond(n, current - 1, False)

print("Triangle pattern:")
print_triangle(4)
print("\nDiamond pattern:")
print_diamond(3)
```

### 4. Advanced: Nested List Processing

These examples demonstrate how recursion naturally handles hierarchical data structures that appear frequently in real-world applications.

```python-execute
def flatten_list(nested_list):
    """Recursively flatten a nested list structure."""
    result = []
    
    for item in nested_list:
        if isinstance(item, list):
            # If item is a list, recursively flatten it
            result.extend(flatten_list(item))
        else:
            # If item is not a list, add it directly
            result.append(item)
    
    return result

def deep_sum(nested):
    """Calculate sum of all numbers in a nested structure."""
    if isinstance(nested, (int, float)):
        return nested
    elif isinstance(nested, list):
        return sum(deep_sum(item) for item in nested)
    else:
        return 0  # Skip non-numeric items

# Test nested processing
nested_data = [1, [2, 3], [4, [5, 6]], 7]
print(f"Nested: {nested_data}")
print(f"Flattened: {flatten_list(nested_data)}")
print(f"Deep sum: {deep_sum(nested_data)}")
```

### 5. Real-World Example: File System Navigation

One of the most practical applications of recursion is navigating hierarchical structures like file systems. Here's how you might calculate the total size of all files in a directory and its subdirectories:

```python-execute
def calculate_directory_size(directory_structure):
    """
    Calculate total size of all files in a directory structure.
    directory_structure is represented as:
    - For files: ("file", filename, size_in_bytes)
    - For directories: ("dir", dirname, [contents...])
    """
    if directory_structure[0] == "file":
        # Base case: it's a file, return its size
        _, filename, size = directory_structure
        print(f"  File: {filename} ({size} bytes)")
        return size
    
    elif directory_structure[0] == "dir":
        # Recursive case: it's a directory, sum all contents
        _, dirname, contents = directory_structure
        print(f"Directory: {dirname}")
        
        total_size = 0
        for item in contents:
            total_size += calculate_directory_size(item)
        
        print(f"  Total in {dirname}: {total_size} bytes")
        return total_size
    
    return 0

# Example file system structure
file_system = (
    "dir", "my_project", [
        ("file", "main.py", 1500),
        ("file", "README.md", 800),
        ("dir", "src", [
            ("file", "utils.py", 2200),
            ("file", "config.py", 600)
        ]),
        ("dir", "tests", [
            ("file", "test_main.py", 1200),
            ("dir", "fixtures", [
                ("file", "sample_data.json", 3400)
            ])
        ])
    ]
)

print("Calculating directory sizes:")
total = calculate_directory_size(file_system)
print(f"\nTotal project size: {total} bytes")
```

This example shows how recursion naturally handles the nested structure of directories within directories - exactly the same pattern we've been learning!

## Integrating Recursion with Previous Concepts

### Combining Recursion with Conditionals and Lists (Ch 2 & 4)

```python-execute
def filter_recursive(numbers, condition_func):
    """Recursively filter a list based on a condition function."""
    # BASE CASE: empty list
    if not numbers:
        return []
    
    # RECURSIVE CASE: check first element
    first = numbers[0]
    rest_filtered = filter_recursive(numbers[1:], condition_func)
    
    if condition_func(first):
        return [first] + rest_filtered
    else:
        return rest_filtered

# Using lambda functions (from Ch 5)
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
even_numbers = filter_recursive(numbers, lambda x: x % 2 == 0)
big_numbers = filter_recursive(numbers, lambda x: x > 5)

print(f"Original: {numbers}")
print(f"Even numbers: {even_numbers}")
print(f"Numbers > 5: {big_numbers}")
```

### Combining Recursion with Functions (Ch 5)

```python-execute
def recursive_map(numbers, transform_func):
    """Apply a function to each element recursively."""
    # BASE CASE: empty list
    if not numbers:
        return []
    
    # RECURSIVE CASE: transform first + map rest
    first_transformed = transform_func(numbers[0])
    rest_mapped = recursive_map(numbers[1:], transform_func)
    
    return [first_transformed] + rest_mapped

# Test with different transformation functions
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared = recursive_map(numbers, lambda x: x ** 2)
doubled = recursive_map(numbers, lambda x: x * 2)

print(f"Original: {numbers}")
print(f"Squared: {squared}")
print(f"Doubled: {doubled}")
```

## Problem-Solving Strategy Review

When approaching a recursive problem, use this systematic approach:

### Step 1: Identify the Recursive Structure
- Does the problem contain smaller versions of itself?
- Can the problem be broken down into simpler cases?
- What would a one-element or empty case look like?

### Step 2: Design Base Cases
- What's the simplest version of this problem?
- When should recursion stop?
- What should be returned in the simplest case?

### Step 3: Design Recursive Cases
- How do you reduce the problem size?
- How do you combine the current work with the recursive result?
- Are you making progress toward the base case?

### Step 4: Implementation and Testing
- Implement the solution following the recursive pattern
- Test with simple cases first
- Trace through execution to verify correctness

## Recursion vs. Iteration: When to Use Each

Choosing between recursion and iteration is a key skill. Here's a practical guide to help you decide:

```table
title: "Recursion vs. Iteration: Decision Guide"
headers: ["Aspect", "Use Recursion When", "Use Iteration When"]
rows:
  - ["Problem Structure", "Problem naturally breaks into smaller identical subproblems", "Need to repeat a process a known number of times"]
  - ["Data Structure", "Working with nested or hierarchical data", "Processing flat data structures sequentially"]

  - ["Code Clarity", "Recursive solution is significantly cleaner", "Iterative solution is more straightforward"]

  - ["Problem Examples", "Binary search, mathematical sequences, file system traversal", "Simple counting, array processing, user input loops"]

  - ["Debugging Needs", "Problem logic is complex but stack trace helps", "Step-by-step debugging with variables is easier"]
caption: "Guidelines for choosing between recursive and iterative approaches"
sortable: true
```

### Quick Decision Framework

**Choose Recursion if:**
- The problem has a clear recursive structure (like mathematical definitions)
- You're working with nested data structures
- The recursive solution is much cleaner than the iterative one
- Performance isn't the primary concern

**Choose Iteration if:**
- You're doing simple sequential processing
- Memory usage is critical
- The problem doesn't naturally break into subproblems
- You need maximum performance

```note title="Real-World Insight"
Most professional developers use recursion for problems where it's natural (like tree traversal) and iteration for everything else. The key is recognizing when recursion makes the solution significantly clearer.
```

## Debugging Recursive Functions 🐛

Recursion can be tricky to debug. Here are practical strategies for when your recursive functions aren't working correctly:

### Common Debugging Techniques

**1. Add Print Statements to Track Flow**
```python-execute
def debug_factorial(n, level=0):
    indent = "  " * level  # Indent to show recursion depth
    print(f"{indent}→ Calling factorial({n})")
    
    if n == 1:
        print(f"{indent}← Base case: returning 1")
        return 1
    
    result = n * debug_factorial(n - 1, level + 1)
    print(f"{indent}← Returning {n} * {n-1}! = {result}")
    return result

print("Debugging factorial(4):")
debug_factorial(4)
```

**2. Use Small Test Cases**
```python-execute
# Always test your recursive function with the smallest possible inputs first
def test_recursive_function():
    # Test base cases first
    print("Testing base cases:")
    print(f"factorial(1) = {debug_factorial(1)}")
    
    # Then test next simplest case  
    print("\nTesting simple recursive case:")
    print(f"factorial(2) = {debug_factorial(2)}")
    
    # Only then test larger cases
    print("\nTesting larger case:")
    print(f"factorial(3) = {debug_factorial(3)}")

test_recursive_function()
```

### Questions to Ask When Debugging

When your recursive function isn't working, ask yourself:

1. **Are my base cases correct?**
   - Do they handle all the simplest inputs?
   - Do they actually stop the recursion?

2. **Am I making progress toward the base case?**
   - Is each recursive call getting closer to a base case?
   - Could I get stuck in infinite recursion?

3. **Am I combining results correctly?**
   - Am I using the return value from the recursive call properly?
   - Is my combination logic (addition, multiplication, etc.) correct?

4. **Have I handled edge cases?**
   - What happens with empty inputs?
   - What happens with negative numbers or zero?
