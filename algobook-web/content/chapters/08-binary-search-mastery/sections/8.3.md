# Binary Search on Answers: Optimization Applications

So far, you've used binary search to find elements in sorted arrays. But here's where binary search becomes truly powerful: you can use it to search through **answer spaces** to solve optimization problems. This technique transforms binary search from a simple search tool into a general-purpose optimization algorithm.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the concept of searching in "answer spaces"
- Apply binary search to optimization problems
- Master the pattern of "binary search on the answer"
- Distinguish between discrete and continuous search spaces
- Solve real-world optimization problems using binary search

## From Arrays to Answer Spaces

Traditional binary search works on sorted arrays, but the same principle applies to any **monotonic function** - a function that consistently increases or decreases. Instead of searching for a value in an array, we search for the optimal answer in a range of possible answers.

```note title="The Key Insight"
If you can answer "Is X a valid/achievable answer?" for any value X, and valid answers form a contiguous range, then you can use binary search to find the optimal answer!
```

### The "Is This Possible?" Pattern

The secret to recognizing binary search on answers is this question pattern:

```note title="Recognition Pattern"
**Can we achieve our goal with answer value X?**
- If YES → try for a better answer (smaller for minimization, larger for maximization)
- If NO → we need a different answer (larger for minimization, smaller for maximization)

This creates the monotonic property that enables binary search!
```

## Example: Finding Square Roots

Let's start with a classic example - finding the square root of a number using binary search:

```python-execute
def sqrt_binary_search(x, precision=0.001):
    """
    Find square root of x using binary search.
    We're searching in the answer space [0, x] for the value whose square equals x.
    """
    if x < 0:
        return None
    if x < 1:
        # For numbers less than 1, square root is between x and 1
        left, right = x, 1.0
    else:
        # For numbers >= 1, square root is between 0 and x
        left, right = 0.0, float(x)
    
    iterations = 0
    print(f"Finding square root of {x}")
    print(f"Searching in range [{left:.3f}, {right:.3f}]")
    print()
    
    while right - left > precision:
        iterations += 1
        mid = (left + right) / 2
        square = mid * mid
        
        print(f"Iteration {iterations}: trying {mid:.6f}")
        print(f"  {mid:.6f}² = {square:.6f}")
        
        if square < x:
            print(f"  Too small, search right half")
            left = mid
        else:
            print(f"  Too big, search left half")
            right = mid
        print()
    
    result = (left + right) / 2
    print(f"Final answer: {result:.6f}")
    print(f"Verification: {result:.6f}² = {result*result:.6f}")
    return result

# Test with different numbers
sqrt_binary_search(25)
print("=" * 50)
sqrt_binary_search(2)
```

```hint title="Continuous vs Discrete Search Spaces"
Notice how we use `right - left > precision` instead of `left <= right` for continuous spaces. We need a stopping condition based on how precise we want our answer to be.
```

## The Pattern: "Can We Achieve X?"

The key to binary search on answers is framing your problem as: "What's the minimum/maximum value where condition X becomes true?" 

### Example Problem: Job Scheduling

**Problem**: You have a list of jobs that take different amounts of time to complete, and a fixed number of workers. What's the minimum time needed for all workers to complete all jobs?

**Constraints**:
- Each worker can only work on one job at a time
- Jobs must be completed in sequence by each worker
- We want to minimize the maximum time any single worker spends

**Key Insight**: If we can complete all jobs in X time units, we can definitely complete them in X+1, X+2, etc. This creates the monotonic property needed for binary search!

Let's see this pattern with a practical implementation:

```python-execute
def can_complete_jobs(jobs, workers, max_time):
    """
    Check if we can complete all jobs with given workers in max_time.
    Each worker can work on jobs sequentially.
    """
    current_worker_time = 0
    workers_used = 1
    
    for job_time in jobs:
        if job_time > max_time:
            return False  # Single job exceeds time limit
            
        if current_worker_time + job_time <= max_time:
            current_worker_time += job_time
        else:
            # Need a new worker
            workers_used += 1
            current_worker_time = job_time
            
            if workers_used > workers:
                return False
    
    return True

def minimum_time_to_complete_jobs(jobs, workers):
    """
    Find minimum time needed to complete all jobs with given number of workers.
    This is a classic "binary search on answer" problem.
    """
    # Answer space: from max(jobs) to sum(jobs)
    left = max(jobs)  # Minimum possible time (longest single job)
    right = sum(jobs)  # Maximum possible time (one worker does everything)
    
    print(f"Jobs: {jobs}")
    print(f"Workers: {workers}")
    print(f"Search space: [{left}, {right}]")
    print()
    
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        print(f"Testing time limit: {mid}")
        
        if can_complete_jobs(jobs, workers, mid):
            print(f"  ✓ Can complete in {mid} time units")
            right = mid  # Try for a smaller time
        else:
            print(f"  ✗ Cannot complete in {mid} time units")
            left = mid + 1  # Need more time
        print()
    
    return left

# Example: 5 jobs with 3 workers
jobs = [3, 2, 3, 1, 4]
workers = 3
result = minimum_time_to_complete_jobs(jobs, workers)
print(f"Minimum time needed: {result}")

# Verify the solution
print(f"\nVerification:")
print(f"Can complete in {result-1}? {can_complete_jobs(jobs, workers, result-1)}")
print(f"Can complete in {result}? {can_complete_jobs(jobs, workers, result)}")
```

```quiz
id: answer-space-concept
question: "When using binary search to find the minimum time needed to complete all jobs, what should you do when you discover that a certain time limit allows you to finish all jobs successfully?"
options:
  - id: a
    text: "Stop searching immediately since you found a valid solution"
    correct: false
    explanation: "While this time works, there might be an even smaller time that also works - you want the minimum time."
  - id: b
    text: "Try an even smaller time limit to see if you can do better"
    correct: true
    explanation: "Correct! Since you're looking for the minimum time, finding a working solution means you should explore smaller time limits to see if they also work."
  - id: c
    text: "Try a larger time limit to make sure the solution is robust"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Larger time limits would definitely work, but you're trying to minimize the time, not maximize it."
  - id: d
    text: "Switch to searching for the maximum time instead"
    correct: false
    explanation: "The problem asks for the minimum time, so you should continue optimizing towards smaller values."
```

## Real-World Problem: Shipping Packages

Let's solve another practical optimization problem that demonstrates the same "binary search on answers" pattern.

### Problem: Minimum Ship Capacity

**Scenario**: You're a shipping company that needs to transport packages using a single ship. Each package has a specific weight, and you must ship all packages within a given number of days.

**Problem**: What's the minimum weight capacity your ship needs to meet the deadline?

**Constraints**:
- Ship can make multiple trips over multiple days
- Packages must be shipped in the order given (can't rearrange)
- Each day, ship loads packages until adding the next would exceed capacity
- Goal: Find the smallest possible ship capacity that meets the deadline

**Key Insight**: If a ship with capacity X can meet the deadline, then a ship with capacity X+1, X+2, etc. can definitely meet it too. Again, we have the monotonic property!

Let's implement this step by step:

```python-execute
def can_ship_within_days(weights, capacity, days):
    """Check if we can ship all packages within given days with given capacity."""
    current_day = 1
    current_weight = 0
    
    for weight in weights:
        if weight > capacity:
            return False  # Single package exceeds capacity
            
        if current_weight + weight <= capacity:
            current_weight += weight
        else:
            # Start a new day
            current_day += 1
            current_weight = weight
            
            if current_day > days:
                return False
    
    return True

def find_minimum_ship_capacity(weights, days):
    """Find minimum capacity needed to ship all packages within given days."""
    # Search space: [max(weights), sum(weights)]
    left = max(weights)  # Must handle largest package
    right = sum(weights)  # Ship everything in one day
    
    print(f"Package weights: {weights}")
    print(f"Must ship within {days} days")
    print(f"Capacity search range: [{left}, {right}]")
    print()
    
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        print(f"Testing capacity: {mid}")
        
        if can_ship_within_days(weights, mid, days):
            print(f"  ✓ Can ship with capacity {mid}")
            right = mid
        else:
            print(f"  ✗ Cannot ship with capacity {mid}")
            left = mid + 1
        print()
    
    return left

# Example shipping problem
packages = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
deadline = 5

capacity = find_minimum_ship_capacity(packages, deadline)
print(f"Minimum ship capacity needed: {capacity}")

# Show the shipping schedule
def show_shipping_schedule(weights, capacity, days):
    print(f"\nShipping schedule with capacity {capacity}:")
    day = 1
    current_load = []
    current_weight = 0
    
    for weight in weights:
        if current_weight + weight <= capacity:
            current_load.append(weight)
            current_weight += weight
        else:
            print(f"Day {day}: {current_load} (total weight: {sum(current_load)})")
            day += 1
            current_load = [weight]
            current_weight = weight
    
    if current_load:
        print(f"Day {day}: {current_load} (total weight: {sum(current_load)})")

show_shipping_schedule(packages, capacity, deadline)
```

## Pattern Recognition: When to Use Binary Search on Answers

Binary search on answers works when you have:

1. **A range of possible answers** (search space)
2. **A monotonic property**: if answer X works, then all larger answers also work (or vice versa)
3. **An efficient way to check** if a specific answer is valid

## Template: Binary Search on Answers Pattern

Here's the general pattern you can follow for any binary search on answers problem:

```note title="Step-by-Step Template"
1. **Define the search space**: What's the range of possible answers?
   - `left = minimum_possible_answer`
   - `right = maximum_possible_answer`

2. **Write the validation function**: Can we achieve the goal with this answer?
   - `is_valid_answer(input_data, candidate_answer)` → returns True/False

3. **Apply binary search logic**:
   - If answer works → try for better (smaller for minimization)
   - If answer doesn't work → need different answer (larger for minimization)

4. **Return the optimal answer**
```

```table
title: Binary Search on Answers Template Structure
headers: ["Component", "Purpose", "Example"]
rows:
  - ["Search Space", "Define min/max possible answers", "[1, sum(packages)] for ship capacity"]
  - ["Validation Function", "Check if answer is achievable", "can_ship_within_days(weights, capacity, days)"]
  - ["Update Logic", "Move towards optimal answer", "If valid: right = mid, else: left = mid + 1"]
  - ["Termination", "When left meets right", "return left (the optimal answer)"]

## Advanced Example: Cutting Ropes

Here's a more complex problem that demonstrates the power of this technique.

### Problem: Maximum Equal-Length Rope Pieces

**Scenario**: You're a contractor who has several ropes of different lengths. You need to cut them into equal-length pieces for a construction project.

**Problem**: What's the maximum length you can make each piece if you need exactly N pieces total?

**Constraints**:
- You have ropes of various lengths
- All pieces must be exactly the same length
- You can only make straight cuts (no joining pieces)
- You need at least N pieces total
- Goal: Maximize the length of each individual piece

**Example**: 
- Ropes: [8, 5, 8] (lengths 8, 5, 8)
- Need: 9 pieces
- Possible solutions: Cut into pieces of length 1 (gets 21 pieces), length 2 (gets 10 pieces), etc.
- Optimal: Cut into pieces of length 2 (gets exactly 10 pieces, which meets our requirement)

**Key Insight**: If we can get N pieces with length X, we can definitely get N pieces with any smaller length. This creates our monotonic property!

Let's implement this step by step:

```python-execute
def max_pieces_with_length(ropes, target_length):
    """Count how many pieces of target_length we can cut from given ropes."""
    total_pieces = 0
    for rope in ropes:
        total_pieces += rope // target_length
    return total_pieces

def find_maximum_piece_length(ropes, needed_pieces):
    """
    Find the maximum length of rope pieces we can cut to get at least 
    needed_pieces total pieces.
    """
    left = 1  # Minimum piece length
    right = max(ropes)  # Maximum possible piece length
    result = 0
    
    print(f"Rope lengths: {ropes}")
    print(f"Need at least {needed_pieces} pieces")
    print(f"Search range: [{left}, {right}]")
    print()
    
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        pieces = max_pieces_with_length(ropes, mid)
        
        print(f"Testing piece length {mid}: can get {pieces} pieces")
        
        if pieces >= needed_pieces:
            result = mid  # This length works, try for longer
            left = mid + 1
            print(f"  ✓ Enough pieces, try longer length")
        else:
            right = mid - 1
            print(f"  ✗ Not enough pieces, try shorter length")
        print()
    
    return result

# Example: Cut ropes to get pieces
rope_lengths = [8, 5, 8]
needed = 9

max_length = find_maximum_piece_length(rope_lengths, needed)
print(f"Maximum piece length: {max_length}")

# Verify
actual_pieces = max_pieces_with_length(rope_lengths, max_length)
print(f"With length {max_length}, we get {actual_pieces} pieces")

if max_length < max(rope_lengths):
    longer_pieces = max_pieces_with_length(rope_lengths, max_length + 1)
    print(f"With length {max_length + 1}, we get {longer_pieces} pieces")
```

```warning title="Maximization vs Minimization"
Notice the difference: for minimization problems (like shipping capacity), we set `right = mid`. For maximization problems (like rope cutting), we set `left = mid + 1` and track the result separately.
```

## Key Takeaways

- **Binary search on answers** extends binary search beyond sorted arrays to optimization problems
- **Monotonic properties** are key: if answer X works, larger/smaller answers should also work
- **Search space definition** is crucial: identify minimum and maximum possible answers
- **Validation function** must efficiently check if a candidate answer is valid
- **Discrete vs continuous** spaces require different termination conditions
- **Minimization and maximization** problems have slightly different update patterns

This technique transforms many optimization problems from complex dynamic programming or greedy approaches into straightforward binary search solutions. In the next section, we'll explore even more advanced applications!
