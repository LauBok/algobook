# Binary Search on Answer Spaces: Optimization Applications

Binary search operates on any set with monotonic structure, not just sorted arrays. When we search arrays, we exploit the monotonic ordering of elements. When we solve optimization problems, we exploit the monotonic ordering of answer quality—if answer X does not work, all answers in one direction does not work either.

## Learning Objectives

- Recognize monotonic structure in optimization problems
- Apply binary search to discrete and continuous answer spaces
- Implement the validation function approach for optimization
- Solve practical optimization problems using answer space search

## Monotonic Structure in Optimization

Both array search and optimization problems share the same algorithmic foundation: **systematic elimination through monotonic structure**.

```table
title: "Monotonic Structure Comparison"
headers: ["Aspect", "Array Search", "Answer Space Search"]
rows:
  - ["Search space", "Array indices `[0, n-1]`", "Answer range [min_answer, max_answer]"]
  - ["Monotonic property", "`arr[i] ≤ arr[i+1]`", "If X works, then X+1, X+2, ... also work"]
  - ["Comparison", "`arr[mid]` vs target", "can_achieve_goal(`mid`) vs requirement"]
  - ["Discrete/Continuous", "Discrete (array indices)", "Discrete (integers) or continuous (real numbers)"]
  - ["Termination", "left > right", "left > right (discrete) or precision reached (continuous)"]

sortable: false
```

The critical insight is the **validation function**: instead of comparing `arr[mid]` with a target, we ask "Can we achieve our goal with candidate answer `mid`?"

```note title="Monotonic Property in Optimization"
For minimization problems: If we can achieve the goal with value X, we can definitely achieve it with any value > X.

For maximization problems: If we can achieve the goal with value X, we can definitely achieve it with any value < X.

This creates the monotonic structure needed for binary search elimination.
```

## Continuous Answer Spaces: Square Root Example

Square root computation demonstrates binary search on continuous answer spaces. The monotonic property: if $y^2 < x$, then the square root is larger than $y$.

```python-execute
def sqrt_binary_search(x, precision=0.001):
    """Find square root using binary search on continuous answer space."""
    if x < 0:
        return None

    # Define search space based on mathematical properties
    if x < 1:
        left, right = x, 1.0  # For x < 1, sqrt(x) is between x and 1
    else:
        left, right = 0.0, float(x)  # For x >= 1, sqrt(x) is between 0 and x

    while right - left > precision:
        mid = (left + right) / 2
        square = mid * mid

        if square < x:
            left = mid  # Need larger value
        else:
            right = mid  # Need smaller value

    return (left + right) / 2

# Test with perfect and non-perfect squares
print(sqrt_binary_search(25))   # Should be close to 5.0
print(sqrt_binary_search(2))    # Should be close to 1.414
print(sqrt_binary_search(0.25)) # Should be close to 0.5
```

```note title="Continuous vs Discrete Termination"
For continuous spaces, we use `right - left > precision` instead of `left <= right`. The algorithm terminates when we reach the desired precision, not when pointers cross.
```

## The Validation Function Approach

Answer space search requires a **validation function** that efficiently determines: "Can we achieve our goal with candidate value X?"

### General Template for Optimization

```python
def solve_optimization_problem(problem_data):
    # Step 1: Define the answer space
    left = minimum_possible_answer
    right = maximum_possible_answer

    # Step 2: Binary search with validation function
    while left < right:  # or left <= right for maximization
        mid = (left + right) // 2

        if can_achieve_goal(problem_data, mid):
            # For minimization: this works, try smaller
            right = mid
        else:
            # For minimization: need larger value
            left = mid + 1

    return left

def can_achieve_goal(problem_data, candidate_answer):
    # Problem-specific validation logic
    # Returns True if candidate_answer allows achieving the goal
    pass
```

### Discrete Example: Job Scheduling

**Problem**: Distribute jobs among workers to minimize maximum worker time.

**Monotonic property**: If jobs can be completed in time X, they can be completed in time X+1, X+2, etc.

```python-execute
def can_complete_jobs(jobs, workers, max_time):
    """Validation function: can we complete all jobs within max_time?"""
    current_worker_time = 0
    workers_used = 1

    for job_time in jobs:
        if job_time > max_time:
            return False

        if current_worker_time + job_time <= max_time:
            current_worker_time += job_time
        else:
            workers_used += 1
            current_worker_time = job_time
            if workers_used > workers:
                return False

    return True

def minimum_completion_time(jobs, workers):
    """Find minimum time to complete all jobs with given workers."""
    left = max(jobs)   # At least as long as the longest job
    right = sum(jobs)  # At most the total time

    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if can_complete_jobs(jobs, workers, mid):
            right = mid  # Try smaller time
        else:
            left = mid + 1  # Need more time

    return left

# Test the algorithm
jobs = [3, 2, 3, 1, 4]
workers = 3
result = minimum_completion_time(jobs, workers)
print(f"Minimum time: {result}")
print(f"Verification: {can_complete_jobs(jobs, workers, result)}")
```

```quiz
id: validation-function-logic
question: "In the job scheduling problem, what does it mean when the validation function returns True for a given time limit?"
options:
  - id: a
    text: "This is the optimal answer"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Finding a working solution doesn't mean it's optimal - there might be smaller time limits that also work."
  - id: b
    text: "We can complete all jobs within this time limit"
    correct: true
    explanation: "Correct! The validation function returning True means the proposed time limit is sufficient to complete all jobs."
  - id: c
    text: "We need to increase the time limit"
    correct: false
    explanation: "If the validation function returns True, the time limit is sufficient - we might even be able to reduce it."
  - id: d
    text: "The jobs cannot be completed"
    correct: false
    explanation: "A True return value means the jobs CAN be completed within the given time limit."
```

## Practical Application: Shipping Capacity

**Problem**: Find the minimum ship capacity to transport packages within a deadline.

**Constraints**: Packages shipped in order, ship makes multiple trips, minimize capacity.

**Monotonic property**: If capacity X works, then capacity X+1, X+2, etc. also work.

```python-execute
def can_ship_within_days(weights, capacity, days):
    """Validation function for shipping problem."""
    current_day = 1
    current_weight = 0

    for weight in weights:
        if weight > capacity:
            return False

        if current_weight + weight <= capacity:
            current_weight += weight
        else:
            current_day += 1
            current_weight = weight
            if current_day > days:
                return False

    return True

def minimum_ship_capacity(weights, days):
    """Find minimum capacity using answer space search."""
    left = max(weights)   # Must handle largest package
    right = sum(weights)  # Ship everything in one day

    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if can_ship_within_days(weights, mid, days):
            right = mid  # Try smaller capacity
        else:
            left = mid + 1  # Need larger capacity

    return left

# Test with practical example
packages = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
deadline = 5
capacity = minimum_ship_capacity(packages, deadline)
print(f"Minimum capacity needed: {capacity}")
print(f"Verification: {can_ship_within_days(packages, capacity, deadline)}")
```

## Algorithm Framework

Answer space search applies when three conditions hold:

1. **Bounded answer space**: Clear minimum and maximum possible values
2. **Monotonic property**: If value X satisfies the constraint, then values in one direction also satisfy it
3. **Efficient validation**: Can quickly check if a candidate answer works

```table
title: "Optimization Problem Classification"
headers: ["Problem Type", "Search Space", "Monotonic Property", "Example"]
rows:
  - ["Minimization", "[min_val, max_val]", "If X works, X+1, X+2, ... work", "Minimum ship capacity"]
  - ["Maximization", "[min_val, max_val]", "If X works, X-1, X-2, ... work", "Maximum rope piece length"]
  - ["Continuous", "[min_val, max_val]", "Smooth monotonic function", "Square root computation"]
  - ["Threshold", "[min_val, max_val]", "Binary property transition", "Kth smallest element"]
caption: Different optimization types sharing the same algorithmic approach
sortable: false
```

### Template Implementation

```python
# Minimization template
def minimize_answer(problem_data):
    left = minimum_possible_answer
    right = maximum_possible_answer

    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if can_achieve_goal(problem_data, mid):
            right = mid  # Try smaller value
        else:
            left = mid + 1  # Need larger value

    return left

# Maximization template
def maximize_answer(problem_data):
    left = minimum_possible_answer
    right = maximum_possible_answer
    result = left

    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if can_achieve_goal(problem_data, mid):
            result = mid  # Record this working value
            left = mid + 1  # Try larger value
        else:
            right = mid - 1  # Value too large

    return result
```

## Maximization Example: Rope Cutting

**Problem**: Cut ropes into equal-length pieces, maximizing piece length while achieving minimum count.

**Monotonic property**: If we can get N pieces with length X, we can get ≥N pieces with any length < X.

```python-execute
def count_pieces(ropes, piece_length):
    """Count total pieces of given length from all ropes."""
    return sum(rope // piece_length for rope in ropes)

def maximum_piece_length(ropes, needed_pieces):
    """Find maximum piece length yielding at least needed_pieces."""
    left = 1
    right = max(ropes)
    result = 0

    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        pieces = count_pieces(ropes, mid)

        if pieces >= needed_pieces:
            result = mid  # This works, try longer
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1  # Too long, try shorter

    return result

# Test maximization algorithm
ropes = [8, 5, 8]
needed = 9
max_length = maximum_piece_length(ropes, needed)
print(f"Maximum piece length: {max_length}")
print(f"Pieces obtained: {count_pieces(ropes, max_length)}")
```

```note title="Maximization vs Minimization Logic"
**Minimization**: If candidate works → try smaller (right = mid)
**Maximization**: If candidate works → try larger (left = mid + 1, track result)

The update direction reverses because we're optimizing in the opposite direction.
```

## Key Principles

Answer space search unifies a broad class of optimization problems under the binary search framework:

- **Monotonic structure**: The fundamental requirement enabling systematic elimination
- **Validation function**: Efficient method to test candidate answers
- **Answer space bounds**: Clear minimum and maximum possible values
- **Update logic**: Direction depends on minimization vs maximization objective
- **Termination conditions**: Differ for discrete vs continuous spaces

This approach reduces complex optimization problems to the familiar binary search algorithm, providing $O(\log n)$ solutions where $n$ represents the answer space size.

Section 8.4 explores more sophisticated applications where the monotonic property requires careful analysis to identify.
