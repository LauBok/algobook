# Practice and Review

Now that you've learned Boolean logic, if statements, and elif chains, it's time to practice these skills through complete programming challenges. This section consolidates your decision-making abilities and prepares you for the next chapter on loops and iteration.

## What You've Learned

This chapter introduced the tools for making programs that can analyze conditions and choose different actions:

- **Boolean expressions** using comparison operators (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=) and logical operators (and, or, not)
- **If statements** that execute code only when conditions are true
- **If-else statements** that handle both true and false cases
- **Elif chains** that choose between multiple options cleanly

You can now implement the "if match found" decision logic from the contact search algorithm introduced in section 1.1.

## Conceptual Review: Test Your Understanding

Before proceeding to programming challenges, verify understanding of key concepts through these assessment questions:

```quiz
id: chapter2-boolean-review
question: "If `age = 16` and `has_license = True`, what does `age >= 18 and has_license` evaluate to?"
options:
  - id: a
    text: "`True`"
    correct: false
    explanation: "For 'and' to be True, both conditions must be True. While has_license is True, age >= 18 is False (16 >= 18 is False)."
  - id: b
    text: "`False`"
    correct: true
    explanation: "Correct! For 'and' to be True, both conditions must be True. Since age >= 18 is False (16 is not >= 18), the whole expression is False."
  - id: c
    text: "16"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This logical expression evaluates to a boolean value (True/False), not a number."
  - id: d
    text: "Error"
    correct: false
    explanation: "This is valid Python syntax that evaluates to False."
```

```quiz
id: chapter2-elif-review
question: "What makes elif chains better than deeply nested if statements?"
options:
  - id: a
    text: They run faster
    correct: false
    explanation: "Performance is similar - the main advantage is readability and maintainability."
  - id: b
    text: They're more readable and easier to understand
    correct: true
    explanation: "Exactly! Elif chains create clean, linear logic that's easy to follow, while nested ifs create confusing indentation levels."
  - id: c
    text: They can handle more conditions
    correct: false
    explanation: "Both approaches can handle the same number of conditions."
  - id: d
    text: They're required by Python
    correct: false
    explanation: "Nested ifs work fine in Python - elif is just a cleaner way to write the same logic."
```

```quiz
id: chapter2-integration-review
question: "To build a program that gets user input and makes decisions based on that input, you need skills from:"
options:
  - id: a
    text: Only Chapter 2 (boolean logic and conditionals)
    correct: false
    explanation: "You need input/output skills from Chapter 1 plus decision-making from Chapter 2."
  - id: b
    text: Only Chapter 1 (variables and input/output)
    correct: false
    explanation: "You need the input/output foundation, but also conditional logic to make decisions."
  - id: c
    text: Both Chapter 1 and Chapter 2
    correct: true
    explanation: "Perfect! Interactive decision-making programs need Chapter 1's input/output/variables PLUS Chapter 2's conditional logic."
  - id: d
    text: Advanced topics beyond these chapters
    correct: false
    explanation: "You can build sophisticated interactive programs with just Chapters 1-2 concepts!"
```

## Programming Challenges

These exercises combine all the concepts from Chapter 2. Each builds on the decision-making patterns you've learned: comparing values, handling multiple conditions, and creating logical program flow.

## Summary

You now have the tools to create programs that make intelligent decisions based on conditions. The Boolean logic and conditional execution skills from this chapter enable you to implement the "if match found" decision logic from the contact search algorithm.

**What's Next:** Chapter 3 introduces loops and iteration, which will enable you to repeat actions multiple times. Combined with the decision-making skills from this chapter, you'll be able to implement the complete contact search algorithm that processes an entire list of contacts.
