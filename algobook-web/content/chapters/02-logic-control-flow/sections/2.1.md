# Boolean Logic and Comparison Operations

Recall the contact search algorithm from section 1.1:

> **ALGORITHM: Sequential Contact Search**
> 1. Start at the first contact in the list
> 2. Compare current contact with target name
> 3. **If match found, return contact information**
> 4. If no match, move to next contact
> 5. Repeat until target found or list exhausted

Step 3 requires the program to make a decision: "Is this contact the one we're looking for?" This decision depends on comparing two values and determining if they match. Such comparisons form the foundation of decision-making in programs, enabling algorithms to choose different paths based on the data they encounter.

This section introduces Boolean logic and comparison operations that enable programs to evaluate conditions and make decisions. Boolean logic provides the mathematical foundation for all conditional execution in computer programming, transforming the sequential programs from Chapter 1 into intelligent systems that can respond to different situations.

## Boolean Fundamentals

Boolean logic, named after mathematician George Boole, provides the mathematical foundation for binary decision systems in computer science. Every conditional operation reduces to a fundamental binary question: Does the specified condition evaluate to True or False? This evaluation determines program execution flow and enables computational decision-making through the assessment of conditions as either true or false. This binary classification allows programs to execute different instructions based on data state, creating the branching behavior that distinguishes intelligent programs from simple sequential execution.

Python implements Boolean values as primitive data types with two possible states: `True` and `False`. These literals require initial capitalizationâ€”lowercase variants (`true`, `false`) generate syntax errors. Boolean values can be assigned to variables just like numbers or strings, enabling programs to store and manipulate logical states.

```python-execute
# Boolean literal values and variable assignment
print("True value:", True)
print("False value:", False)

# Storing Boolean values in variables
condition_met = True
error_detected = False
search_complete = False

print("Condition status:", condition_met)
print("Error status:", error_detected)
print("Search status:", search_complete)
```

## Comparison Operations

Boolean values most commonly result from comparison operations that evaluate relationships between data values. These operations answer questions like "Are these values equal?" or "Is this number larger than that number?" Consider the contact search comparison `current_contact_name == target_name`, which produces either `True` if the names match or `False` otherwise. This Boolean result enables the algorithm to decide whether to return the contact or continue searching, transforming a simple comparison into the foundation for algorithmic decision-making.

Python provides systematic comparison operators for relational evaluation:

### Equality and Inequality Operators

The most fundamental comparisons determine whether values are the same or different:

```python-execute
# Contact search example
target_name = "Sarah Johnson"
current_contact = "Bob Smith"

# Equal to (==) - asks "are these exactly the same?"
print("Found target contact?", current_contact == target_name)
print("Is current contact Bob?", current_contact == "Bob Smith")

# Not equal to (!=) - asks "are these different?"
print("Not the target?", current_contact != target_name)
print("Different from Sarah?", current_contact != "Sarah Johnson")
```

```warning title="Critical Distinction"
Common mistake: `=` stores a value in a variable, `==` compares two values. Using `=` when you mean `==` is a frequent error.
```

### Number Comparisons

Numerical comparisons evaluate size relationships and range membership:

```python-execute
# Comparing numbers
score = 85
passing_grade = 70

print("Score:", score)
print("Passing grade:", passing_grade)

# Greater than (>) - asks "is the first number bigger?"
print("Score > 90?", score > 90)                    # False
print("Score > passing_grade?", score > passing_grade)  # True

# Less than (<) - asks "is the first number smaller?"
print("Score < 60?", score < 60)                    # False
print("Score < 100?", score < 100)                  # True

# Greater than or equal (>=) - asks "is it bigger or the same?"
print("Score >= 85?", score >= 85)                  # True
print("Score >= 90?", score >= 90)                  # False

# Less than or equal (<=) - asks "is it smaller or the same?"
print("Score <= 85?", score <= 85)                  # True
print("Score <= 80?", score <= 80)                  # False
```

### Text Comparisons

```python-execute
# Comparing text (strings)
student_name = "Bob"
correct_password = "secret123"
entered_password = "secret123"

print("Student name is Bob?", student_name == "Bob")       # True
print("Student name is Alice?", student_name == "Alice")   # False
print("Password correct?", entered_password == correct_password)  # True
print("Name comes after 'Alice'?", student_name > "Alice") # True (alphabetical)
```

When comparing text, Python uses alphabetical order. "B" comes after "A", so "Bob" > "Alice" evaluates to True.

## Logical Operators

Real decisions often depend on multiple factors. Python provides three logical operators that combine Boolean expressions:

### The `and` Operator

The `and` operator requires both conditions to be true for the result to be true. If any condition is false, the entire expression is false.

**Rule**: `True and True` = `True`; all other combinations = `False`

```python-execute
# Using 'and' - both conditions must be true
temperature = 75
is_sunny = True

print("Temperature:", temperature)
print("Is sunny:", is_sunny)

# Perfect day requires good temperature AND sunshine
perfect_day = temperature > 70 and is_sunny
print("Perfect day for picnic?", perfect_day)

# Let's try when one condition is false
cold_temperature = 50
cold_day = cold_temperature > 70 and is_sunny
print("Cold day good for picnic?", cold_day)
```

### The `or` Operator

The `or` operator requires at least one condition to be true for the result to be true.

**Rule**: `False or False` = `False`; all other combinations = `True`

```python-execute
# Using 'or' - at least one condition must be true
has_umbrella = False
is_indoors = True

print("Has umbrella:", has_umbrella)
print("Is indoors:", is_indoors)

# Stay dry if you have umbrella OR you're inside
will_stay_dry = has_umbrella or is_indoors
print("Will stay dry?", will_stay_dry)             # True (indoors helps)

# Going outside without umbrella
going_outside = True
will_get_wet = going_outside and not (has_umbrella or is_indoors)
print("Will get wet?", will_get_wet)               # True
```

### The `not` Operator

The `not` operator inverts Boolean values, converting True to False and False to True.

**Rule**: `not True` = `False`; `not False` = `True`

```python-execute
# Using 'not' - flips the truth value
is_weekend = False
is_holiday = False

print("Is weekend:", is_weekend)
print("Is holiday:", is_holiday)

# Work day is when it's NOT weekend AND NOT holiday
is_work_day = not is_weekend and not is_holiday
print("Is work day?", is_work_day)                 # True

# Opposite check
is_free_day = is_weekend or is_holiday
print("Is free day?", is_free_day)                 # False
print("Not a free day?", not is_free_day)          # True
```

## Combining Boolean Logic

Boolean expressions become powerful when combined to make complex decisions. Consider evaluating multiple criteria for contact search optimization:

```python-execute
# Contact search with multiple criteria
print("=== Enhanced Contact Search ===")

# Contact information
contact_name = "Sarah Johnson"
contact_age = 25
contact_active = True

# Search criteria
target_name = "Sarah Johnson"
min_age = 18
requires_active = True

# Individual comparisons
name_matches = contact_name == target_name
age_sufficient = contact_age >= min_age
is_active = contact_active == requires_active

print(f"Name matches: {name_matches}")
print(f"Age sufficient: {age_sufficient}")
print(f"Account active: {is_active}")

# Combined criteria using logical operators
perfect_match = name_matches and age_sufficient and is_active
print(f"Perfect match: {perfect_match}")
```

      is_sunny = True

      True
      False

  - Remember that age >= 18 with age = 25 evaluates to True
  - For 'and' operations, both conditions must be True
  - For 'or' operations, only one condition needs to be True
  - The 'not' operator flips True to False and False to True

### Knowledge Assessment

```quiz
id: boolean-basics
question: Which of these creates a boolean value?
options:
  - id: a
    text: "`age = 18`"
    correct: false
    explanation: This assigns the number 18 to a variable, not a boolean.
  - id: b
    text: "`age == 18`"
    correct: true
    explanation: Correct! This compares age to 18 and results in True or False.
  - id: c
    text: "`age + 18`"
    correct: false
    explanation: This adds numbers together, resulting in a number, not a boolean.
  - id: d
    text: "`print(age)`"
    correct: false
    explanation: This displays a value but doesn't create a boolean.
```

```quiz
id: logical-operators
question: "What does `True and False` evaluate to?"
options:
  - id: a
    text: "`True`"
    correct: false
    explanation: With 'and', both sides must be True. Since False is present, the result is False.
  - id: b
    text: "`False`"
    correct: true
    explanation: Correct! With 'and', both conditions must be True. Since one is False, the result is False.
  - id: c
    text: "Maybe"
    correct: false
    explanation: Boolean logic only has True and False values, never "Maybe".
  - id: d
    text: "Error"
    correct: false
    explanation: This is valid Python code that evaluates to False.
```

```quiz
id: comparison-operators
question: "If `score = 85`, what does `score >= 80 and score < 90` evaluate to?"
options:
  - id: a
    text: "`True`"
    correct: true
    explanation: Correct! 85 >= 80 is True, and 85 < 90 is True, so True and True is True.
  - id: b
    text: "`False`"
    correct: false
    explanation: Both conditions are true (85 >= 80 and 85 < 90), so the result is True.
  - id: c
    text: "85"
    correct: false
    explanation: This expression evaluates to a boolean (True/False), not the number 85.
  - id: d
    text: "Error"
    correct: false
    explanation: This is valid syntax and evaluates to True.
```
