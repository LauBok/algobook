# Boolean Logic: True, False, and Comparisons

Make your programs smart - teach them to make decisions! In Chapter 1, you learned to store data in variables and perform calculations. Now we'll learn how to make programs that can think and respond differently based on the data they receive.

## The Foundation of Decision Making

Think about how you make decisions every day:

> 💭 **"Is it raining? Then I'll bring an umbrella."**  
> 🎉 **"Is my grade above 90? Then I'll celebrate!"**  
> 🏪 **"Is the store open? Then I can go shopping."**

Every decision in programming works the same way - it comes down to one simple question: **Is this true or false?** 

```note title="Meet Boolean Logic"
**Boolean logic** is named after mathematician George Boole. Just like your daily decisions, programming decisions start with yes/no questions that have clear **True** or **False** answers.
```

## True and False: Python's Basic Truth Values

Python has two special values for representing true and false:

```python-execute
# Python's boolean values
print("True value:", True)
print("False value:", False)

# These are built into Python
is_sunny = True
is_raining = False

print("Is it sunny?", is_sunny)
print("Is it raining?", is_raining)
```

```note title="Capitalization Matters!"
In Python, boolean values must start with a capital letter: `True` and `False`. Writing `true` or `false` (lowercase) will cause an error.
```

## Comparing Values: The Foundation of Decisions

The most common way to get True or False values is by **comparing things**. Think of it like asking questions about your data:

```hint title="Questions Your Programs Can Ask"
🗳️ **"Is this person old enough to vote?"** → comparing age to 18  
🎯 **"Did I get a perfect score?"** → comparing score to 100  
🔐 **"Is my password correct?"** → comparing entered text to stored password
```

Python gives you several **comparison operators** to ask these questions:

### Basic Comparison Operators

Let's start with the most important operators: checking if things are equal or different.

```python-execute
# Comparison operators in action
age = 18
temperature = 72
name = "Alice"

# Equal to (==) - asks "are these exactly the same?"
print("Is age exactly 18?", age == 18)
print("Is temperature 80?", temperature == 80)

# Not equal to (!=) - asks "are these different?"
print("Is age not 20?", age != 20)
print("Is name not Alice?", name != "Alice")
```

**Note**: Lines starting with `#` are comments - they help explain the code but don't run. You'll see the actual True/False results when the code executes.

```warning title="Common Mistake: = vs =="
Remember: `=` stores a value in a variable, `==` compares two values. Using `=` when you mean `==` is a very common error!
```

### Number Comparisons

For numbers, we often need to compare sizes and ranges. These operators help us ask questions like:

💰 **"Is this enough?"**  
📊 **"Is this too much?"**  
✅ **"Does this qualify?"**

```python-execute
# Comparing numbers
score = 85
passing_grade = 70

print("Score:", score)
print("Passing grade:", passing_grade)

# Greater than (>) - asks "is the first number bigger?"
print("Score > 90?", score > 90)                    # False
print("Score > passing_grade?", score > passing_grade)  # True

# Less than (<) - asks "is the first number smaller?"
print("Score < 60?", score < 60)                    # False
print("Score < 100?", score < 100)                  # True

# Greater than or equal (>=) - asks "is it bigger or the same?"
print("Score >= 85?", score >= 85)                  # True
print("Score >= 90?", score >= 90)                  # False

# Less than or equal (<=) - asks "is it smaller or the same?"
print("Score <= 85?", score <= 85)                  # True
print("Score <= 80?", score <= 80)                  # False
```

### Text Comparisons

```python-execute
# Comparing text (strings)
student_name = "Bob"
correct_password = "secret123"
entered_password = "secret123"

print("Student name is Bob?", student_name == "Bob")       # True
print("Student name is Alice?", student_name == "Alice")   # False
print("Password correct?", entered_password == correct_password)  # True
print("Name comes after 'Alice'?", student_name > "Alice") # True (alphabetical)
```

```hint title="Text Comparison"
When comparing text, Python uses alphabetical order. "B" comes after "A", so "Bob" > "Alice" is True.
```

## Combining Comparisons with Logical Operators

Real decisions often depend on multiple factors:

```note title="Real-World Logic"
🏖️ "I'll go to the beach if it's sunny **AND** warm"  
☔ "I'll bring an umbrella if it's raining **OR** looks cloudy"  
🍕 "I'll order pizza if I'm **NOT** in the mood to cook"
```

Python provides three **logical operators** that work exactly like these everyday words:

### The `and` Operator

```note title="The Picky Friend"
The `and` operator is like a picky friend - **both** conditions must be true for the result to be true. If even one condition is false, the whole thing is false.

**Rule**: `True and True` = `True`  
Everything else = `False`
```

```python-execute
# Using 'and' - both conditions must be true
temperature = 75
is_sunny = True

print("Temperature:", temperature)
print("Is sunny:", is_sunny)

# Perfect day requires good temperature AND sunshine
perfect_day = temperature > 70 and is_sunny
print("Perfect day for picnic?", perfect_day)

# Let's try when one condition is false
cold_temperature = 50
cold_day = cold_temperature > 70 and is_sunny
print("Cold day good for picnic?", cold_day)
```

### The `or` Operator

```hint title="Multiple Paths to Success"
The `or` operator is more flexible - it only needs **at least one** condition to be true. Think of it as giving you multiple ways to succeed.

**Rule**: `False or False` = `False`  
Everything else = `True`
```

```python-execute
# Using 'or' - at least one condition must be true
has_umbrella = False
is_indoors = True

print("Has umbrella:", has_umbrella)
print("Is indoors:", is_indoors)

# Stay dry if you have umbrella OR you're inside
will_stay_dry = has_umbrella or is_indoors
print("Will stay dry?", will_stay_dry)             # True (indoors helps)

# Going outside without umbrella
going_outside = True
will_get_wet = going_outside and not (has_umbrella or is_indoors)
print("Will get wet?", will_get_wet)               # True
```

### The `not` Operator

```note title="The Opposite Day Operator"
The `not` operator is like saying "the opposite of" - it flips True to False and False to True. Perfect for expressing things like "if it's NOT raining" or "if the password is NOT correct".

**Rule**: `not True` = `False`  
`not False` = `True`
```

```python-execute
# Using 'not' - flips the truth value
is_weekend = False
is_holiday = False

print("Is weekend:", is_weekend)
print("Is holiday:", is_holiday)

# Work day is when it's NOT weekend AND NOT holiday
is_work_day = not is_weekend and not is_holiday
print("Is work day?", is_work_day)                 # True

# Opposite check
is_free_day = is_weekend or is_holiday
print("Is free day?", is_free_day)                 # False
print("Not a free day?", not is_free_day)          # True
```

## Putting It All Together: Interactive Boolean Logic

Now that you understand how to create True/False values and combine them, let's build some interactive programs that use boolean logic to make smart decisions. We'll combine the comparison and logical operators you just learned with the input/output skills from Chapter 1:

```python-execute
# Age verification program
print("=== Age Verification ===")
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

# Check different age categories
is_child = age < 13
is_teenager = age >= 13 and age < 20
is_adult = age >= 18
can_vote = age >= 18
can_rent_car = age >= 25

print(f"Age: {age}")
print(f"Is child (under 13): {is_child}")
print(f"Is teenager (13-19): {is_teenager}")
print(f"Is adult (18+): {is_adult}")
print(f"Can vote: {can_vote}")
print(f"Can rent car: {can_rent_car}")
```


## Practice Exercises

hints:
  - Remember that age >= 18 with age = 25 evaluates to True
  - For 'and' operations, both conditions must be True
  - For 'or' operations, only one condition needs to be True
  - The 'not' operator flips True to False and False to True

## Check Your Understanding

```quiz
id: boolean-basics
question: Which of these creates a boolean value?
options:
  - id: a
    text: "`age = 18`"
    correct: false
    explanation: This assigns the number 18 to a variable, not a boolean.
  - id: b
    text: "`age == 18`"
    correct: true
    explanation: Correct! This compares age to 18 and results in True or False.
  - id: c
    text: "`age + 18`"
    correct: false
    explanation: This adds numbers together, resulting in a number, not a boolean.
  - id: d
    text: "`print(age)`"
    correct: false
    explanation: This displays a value but doesn't create a boolean.
```

```quiz
id: logical-operators
question: "What does `True and False` evaluate to?"
options:
  - id: a
    text: "`True`"
    correct: false
    explanation: With 'and', both sides must be True. Since False is present, the result is False.
  - id: b
    text: "`False`"
    correct: true
    explanation: Correct! With 'and', both conditions must be True. Since one is False, the result is False.
  - id: c
    text: "Maybe"
    correct: false
    explanation: Boolean logic only has True and False values, never "Maybe".
  - id: d
    text: "Error"
    correct: false
    explanation: This is valid Python code that evaluates to False.
```

```quiz
id: comparison-operators
question: "If `score = 85`, what does `score >= 80 and score < 90` evaluate to?"
options:
  - id: a
    text: "`True`"
    correct: true
    explanation: Correct! 85 >= 80 is True, and 85 < 90 is True, so True and True is True.
  - id: b
    text: "`False`"
    correct: false
    explanation: Both conditions are true (85 >= 80 and 85 < 90), so the result is True.
  - id: c
    text: "85"
    correct: false
    explanation: This expression evaluates to a boolean (True/False), not the number 85.
  - id: d
    text: "Error"
    correct: false
    explanation: This is valid syntax and evaluates to True.
```

## What You've Learned

In this section, you've mastered the foundation of program decision-making:

1. **Boolean Values** - `True` and `False` as the basis of all decisions
2. **Comparison Operators** - `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=` for comparing values
3. **Logical Operators** - `and`, `or`, `not` for combining conditions
4. **Practical Applications** - Using boolean logic with user input from Chapter 1

These boolean expressions are the building blocks for making your programs smart and responsive. In the next section, we'll learn how to use these True/False values to make your programs take different actions based on conditions.

## Looking Ahead

You now understand how to create True/False values and combine them with logical operators. Next, we'll learn how to use these boolean values to control what your program does - making it execute different code depending on whether conditions are true or false.

The boolean logic you've learned here works the same way in every programming language. This fundamental skill will serve you throughout your entire programming journey!
