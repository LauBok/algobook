# Multiple Choices and Complex Decisions

You've mastered if and if-else for simple yes/no decisions. But life isn't always that simple! 

```note title="Life Has More Than Two Choices"
Think about choosing what to wear based on the weather:

🧥 **Winter coat**  
🧥 **Light jacket**  
🧶 **Sweater**  
👕 **T-shirt**

That's **more than two choices!**
```

In this section, you'll learn to handle multiple options using `elif` (else-if) statements, allowing your programs to make sophisticated decisions with many possible outcomes.

## The Problem with Nested If Statements

What if you wanted to assign letter grades based on numerical scores? Using only the if-else statements from Section 2.2, you'd have to nest them like this, creating a "staircase" effect that's hard to read and even harder to modify:

```python-execute
# Messy nested if statements from Section 2.2
score = 85

if score >= 90:
    print("Grade: A")
else:
    if score >= 80:
        print("Grade: B") 
    else:
        if score >= 70:
            print("Grade: C")
        else:
            if score >= 60:
                print("Grade: D")
            else:
                print("Grade: F")
```

```warning title="The Staircase Problem"
This works, but look at all that indentation! Each condition pushes the code further right, and adding new grade levels becomes a nightmare.

📉 **Gets harder to read**  
🔧 **Difficult to modify**  
😵 **Confusing to debug**
```

There's a much cleaner way!

## Introducing Elif: Elegant Multiple Choices

```hint title="The Elif Solution"
The `elif` (short for "else if") statement is Python's way of saying:

💭 **"If the first condition didn't work, try this one instead."**

It creates a clean, readable list of options that Python checks one by one until it finds a match.
```

Look how much cleaner the same grade logic becomes:

```python-execute
# Much cleaner with elif!
score = 85

if score >= 90:
    print("Grade: A - Excellent!")
elif score >= 80:
    print("Grade: B - Good work!")
elif score >= 70:
    print("Grade: C - Acceptable")
elif score >= 60:
    print("Grade: D - Needs improvement")
else:
    print("Grade: F - See instructor")

print("Grade calculation complete.")
```

```note title="How Elif Works"
Think of elif chains like a multiple-choice test where you can only pick one answer:

📝 **Python reads from top to bottom**  
🎯 **Stops at the FIRST True condition**  
⏭️ **Skips all remaining elif and else blocks**  
1️⃣ **Only ONE block will ever run!**
```

## Elif Chain Structure

Every elif chain follows this logical pattern - like a decision flowchart written in code:

```python
if condition1:
    # First choice
elif condition2:
    # Second choice  
elif condition3:
    # Third choice
else:
    # Default choice (optional)
```

You can have as many `elif` statements as you need. The `else` at the end is optional, but it's a good safety net to catch any cases you might have missed.

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Traffic Light System

```python-execute
# Traffic light decision system
print("=== Traffic Light System ===")
light_color = input("What color is the traffic light? (red/yellow/green): ")
light_color = light_color.lower()

if light_color == "green":
    print("GO! Proceed through intersection.")
    print("Drive safely and watch for pedestrians.")
elif light_color == "yellow":
    print("CAUTION! Slow down and prepare to stop.")
    print("Don't speed up to beat the light!")
elif light_color == "red":
    print("STOP! Do not enter the intersection.")
    print("Wait for green light.")
else:
    print("ERROR: Invalid traffic light color!")
    print("Please enter red, yellow, or green.")

print("Drive safely!")
```

### Example 2: Weather-Based Activity Recommender

```python-execute
# Activity recommender based on temperature
print("=== Activity Recommender ===")
temperature = float(input("What's the temperature (°F)? "))

if temperature >= 85:
    print("Perfect for swimming or water activities!")
    print("Don't forget sunscreen and water.")
elif temperature >= 75:
    print("Great weather for outdoor sports!")
    print("Try hiking, cycling, or picnic.")
elif temperature >= 65:
    print("Nice day for a walk in the park.")
    print("Light jacket might be good.")
elif temperature >= 50:
    print("Good for indoor activities or shopping.")
    print("If going out, wear a jacket.")
elif temperature >= 32:
    print("Cold! Stay warm indoors.")
    print("Hot cocoa and books sound nice.")
else:
    print("Freezing! Be very careful outside.")
    print("Dress warmly and watch for ice.")

print("Enjoy your day!")
```

### Example 3: Simple Menu System

```python-execute
# Restaurant menu ordering system
print("=== Joe's Diner Menu ===")
print("1. Burger - $8.99")
print("2. Pizza - $12.50")
print("3. Salad - $6.75")
print("4. Soup - $4.50")

choice = input("Enter your choice (1-4): ")

if choice == "1":
    print("You ordered: Burger - $8.99")
    print("Comes with fries and a pickle!")
elif choice == "2":
    print("You ordered: Pizza - $12.50") 
    print("Fresh from our wood-fired oven!")
elif choice == "3":
    print("You ordered: Salad - $6.75")
    print("Fresh greens with your choice of dressing!")
elif choice == "4":
    print("You ordered: Soup - $4.50")
    print("Today's special: Chicken Noodle!")
else:
    print("Invalid choice! Please select 1-4.")
    print("Ask server for help.")

print("Thanks for dining with us!")
```

## Combining Conditions with And/Or

Remember the logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`) from Section 2.1? They become even more powerful when combined with elif statements. You can create sophisticated decision criteria that consider multiple factors at once.

Let's build a realistic college admission system that considers multiple criteria:

```python-execute
# College admission with multiple criteria
print("=== College Admission System ===")
gpa = float(input("Enter your GPA (0.0-4.0): "))
sat_score = int(input("Enter your SAT score: "))
extracurriculars = int(input("Hours of extracurricular activities per week: "))

if gpa >= 3.8 and sat_score >= 1400:
    print("ACCEPTED! Outstanding academic performance!")
    print("Scholarship opportunities available.")
elif gpa >= 3.5 and sat_score >= 1200:
    print("ACCEPTED! Strong academic record.")
    print("Welcome to our university!")
elif gpa >= 3.0 and (sat_score >= 1100 or extracurriculars >= 10):
    print("ACCEPTED! Good balance of academics and activities.")
    print("We value well-rounded students.")
elif gpa >= 2.5 and sat_score >= 1000 and extracurriculars >= 15:
    print("CONDITIONAL ACCEPTANCE - Summer prep program required.")
    print("Strong extracurriculars show great potential!")
else:
    print("NOT ACCEPTED at this time.")
    print("Consider community college and reapply in two years.")

print("Best of luck in your educational journey!")
```

## Algorithms Using Multiple Decisions

Now let's apply elif statements to solve classic programming problems. These logical challenges appear everywhere in computer science - from basic utilities to complex systems.

Each example demonstrates how elif chains elegantly solve problems that would be messy with nested if statements:

### Algorithm 1: Maximum of Three Numbers

This classic problem appears in many contexts: finding the highest score, the warmest day, or the most expensive item. The logic is simple but requires careful thinking about all the cases.

```python-execute
# Find the maximum of three numbers
print("=== Find Maximum of Three Numbers ===")
num1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter second number: "))
num3 = float(input("Enter third number: "))

# We only need to check two conditions because of the else clause
if num1 >= num2 and num1 >= num3:
    maximum = num1
    print(f"Maximum is: {maximum} (first number)")
elif num2 >= num1 and num2 >= num3:
    maximum = num2
    print(f"Maximum is: {maximum} (second number)")
else:
    # If neither num1 nor num2 is largest, then num3 must be
    maximum = num3
    print(f"Maximum is: {maximum} (third number)")

print(f"The three numbers were: {num1}, {num2}, {num3}")
```

### Algorithm 2: Absolute Value Calculator

```python-execute
# Calculate absolute value (distance from zero)
print("=== Absolute Value Calculator ===")
number = float(input("Enter a number: "))

if number > 0:
    absolute_value = number
    print(f"The absolute value of {number} is {absolute_value}")
    print("(Positive numbers stay the same)")
elif number < 0:
    absolute_value = -number  # Flip the sign
    print(f"The absolute value of {number} is {absolute_value}")
    print("(Negative numbers become positive)")
else:
    absolute_value = 0
    print(f"The absolute value of {number} is {absolute_value}")
    print("(Zero stays zero)")

print("Absolute value represents distance from zero.")
```

### Algorithm 3: Triangle Type Classifier

```python-execute
# Classify triangle type based on side lengths
print("=== Triangle Classifier ===")
side1 = float(input("Enter length of first side: "))
side2 = float(input("Enter length of second side: "))
side3 = float(input("Enter length of third side: "))

# First check if it forms a valid triangle
if side1 + side2 > side3 and side1 + side3 > side2 and side2 + side3 > side1:
    print("Valid triangle! Analyzing type...")
    
    if side1 == side2 == side3:
        print("EQUILATERAL triangle - all sides equal")
        print("All angles are 60 degrees")
    elif side1 == side2 or side1 == side3 or side2 == side3:
        print("ISOSCELES triangle - two sides equal")
        print("Two angles are equal")
    else:
        print("SCALENE triangle - all sides different")
        print("All angles are different")
else:
    print("NOT a valid triangle!")
    print("Sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side")

print("Triangle analysis complete.")
```

## Check Your Understanding

```quiz
id: elif-basics
question: In an if-elif-else chain, how many blocks of code will execute?
options:
  - id: a
    text: "All blocks that have True conditions"
    correct: false
    explanation: Only the FIRST True condition executes, then Python skips the rest.
  - id: b
    text: "Exactly one block"
    correct: true
    explanation: Correct! Python executes the first True condition it finds, then skips all remaining elif and else blocks.
  - id: c
    text: "Only the if block"
    correct: false
    explanation: Any block can execute - if, elif, or else - depending on which condition is True first.
  - id: d
    text: "The if block and all elif blocks"
    correct: false
    explanation: Only one block executes total, not multiple blocks.
```

```quiz
id: elif-order
question: Why does order matter in elif chains?
options:
  - id: a
    text: "Python requires alphabetical order"
    correct: false
    explanation: Order has nothing to do with alphabetical sorting.
  - id: b
    text: "Python checks conditions from top to bottom and stops at the first True"
    correct: true
    explanation: Exactly! Python evaluates conditions in order and stops at the first True, so order affects which condition "wins".
  - id: c
    text: "Order doesn't matter at all"
    correct: false
    explanation: Order is very important! Different orders can produce different results.
  - id: d
    text: "The else block must come first"
    correct: false
    explanation: The else block always comes last, after all if and elif blocks.
```

```quiz
id: complex-conditions
question: What does `gpa >= 3.0 and sat_score >= 1200` evaluate to if gpa is 3.5 and sat_score is 1100?
options:
  - id: a
    text: "True"
    correct: false
    explanation: For 'and' to be True, BOTH conditions must be True. The SAT score condition (1100 >= 1200) is False.
  - id: b
    text: "False"
    correct: true
    explanation: Correct! While gpa >= 3.0 is True (3.5 >= 3.0), sat_score >= 1200 is False (1100 >= 1200), so True and False = False.
  - id: c
    text: "3.5"
    correct: false
    explanation: This logical expression evaluates to a boolean (True/False), not a number.
  - id: d
    text: "Error"
    correct: false
    explanation: This is valid syntax that evaluates to False.
```
