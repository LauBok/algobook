# Basic Iteration: The Power of Repetition

Section 2.1 enabled programs to make decisions through branching. However, many algorithms require performing the same operations multiple times. Consider these fundamental programming needs that conditional execution alone cannot address:

- **Processing lists**: A grading program needs to calculate the average of 30 student scores
- **User interaction**: A password system needs to keep asking until the user enters the correct password
- **Input validation**: A program needs to repeatedly request valid input when users enter invalid data
- **Counting**: A program needs to print numbers from 1 to 100

Sequential execution with branching can handle decisions, but it cannot efficiently handle repetition. **Iteration** - the systematic repetition of operations - provides this essential capability.

## The Need for Repetition

Imagine writing a program to print numbers from 1 to 10 without loops:

```python
print(1)
print(2)
print(3)
print(4)
print(5)
print(6)
print(7)
print(8)
print(9)
print(10)
```

This approach becomes impractical when:
- The number of repetitions is unknown beforehand
- The number of repetitions depends on user input
- You need to repeat hundreds or thousands of times
- The number of repetitions changes based on data

Real programs need a systematic way to repeat operations without writing identical code multiple times.

## While Loops: Controlled Repetition

The **while loop** provides controlled repetition: "WHILE this condition is true, KEEP executing these operations." The loop continues until the condition becomes false.

### While Loop Syntax

```python
while condition:
    # Code that repeats while condition is True
    # This code must eventually make condition False
```

**The Four Parts of a While Loop:**
1. `while` - the keyword that starts the loop
2. condition - any expression that evaluates to True or False
3. `:` - the colon that indicates the code block
4. indented code - the operations to repeat while condition is True

### Basic Counting Example

```python-execute
# Count from 1 to 5 using a while loop
count = 1

print("Counting with a while loop:")
while count <= 5:
    print(f"Count: {count}")
    count = count + 1  # This eventually makes condition False

print("Counting complete!")
print(f"Final count value: {count}")
```

**How This Works:**
1. `count` starts at 1
2. Check: Is `count <= 5`? Yes (1 ≤ 5), so enter the loop
3. Print the count, then increment: `count` becomes 2
4. Check: Is `count <= 5`? Yes (2 ≤ 5), so continue
5. This repeats until `count` becomes 6
6. Check: Is `count <= 5`? No (6 > 5), so exit the loop

## Loop Control Patterns

### Counter Variables

Counter variables track how many times a loop has executed:

```python-execute
# Process exactly 3 items
item_count = 0
total_value = 0

while item_count < 3:
    item_count = item_count + 1
    item_value = int(input(f"Enter value for item {item_count}: "))
    total_value = total_value + item_value
    print(f"Added item {item_count} with value {item_value}")

print(f"Processed {item_count} items")
print(f"Total value: {total_value}")
```

### Accumulator Variables

Accumulator variables collect results across multiple loop iterations:

```python-execute
# Calculate sum of numbers from 1 to 5
number = 1
sum_total = 0

print("Calculating sum of numbers 1 to 5:")
while number <= 5:
    print(f"Adding {number} to sum")
    sum_total = sum_total + number
    number = number + 1

print(f"Final sum: {sum_total}")
```

### Input Validation Loops

One of the most practical uses of while loops is ensuring valid user input:

```python-execute
# Keep asking for password until correct
correct_password = "secret123"
attempts = 0
max_attempts = 3

while attempts < max_attempts:
    attempts = attempts + 1
    entered_password = input(f"Enter password (attempt {attempts}): ")

    if entered_password == correct_password:
        print("Access granted!")
        break  # Exit the loop immediately
    else:
        print("Incorrect password")

    if attempts == max_attempts:
        print("Maximum attempts reached. Access denied.")
```

## Loop Termination and Safety

### Ensuring Loops End

Every while loop must eventually make its condition False, or it will run forever (infinite loop):

```python
# DANGEROUS: This loop never ends!
# count = 1
# while count <= 5:
#     print(count)
#     # Missing: count = count + 1
```

**Safe Loop Checklist:**
1. Initialize the loop variable before the while statement
2. Check that the condition can become False
3. Modify the loop variable inside the loop body
4. Ensure the modification moves toward making the condition False

### Loop Variables Must Change

```python-execute
# Safe loop: variable changes toward the exit condition
temperature = 100

print("Cooling simulation:")
while temperature > 70:
    print(f"Temperature: {temperature}°F")
    temperature = temperature - 5  # Moves toward exit condition

print(f"Final temperature: {temperature}°F")
print("Cooling complete!")
```

## Comprehension Check

Test your understanding of while loops:

```quiz
id: while-loop-basics
question: "What happens if the condition in a while loop is initially False?"
options:
  - id: a
    text: "The loop runs once anyway"
    correct: false
    explanation: "If the condition is False from the start, the loop body never executes - not even once."
  - id: b
    text: "The loop body never executes"
    correct: true
    explanation: "Correct! Python checks the condition before entering the loop. If it's False initially, the loop body is skipped entirely."
  - id: c
    text: "Python reports an error"
    correct: false
    explanation: "A False condition is perfectly normal - it just means the loop doesn't need to run."
  - id: d
    text: "The condition automatically becomes True"
    correct: false
    explanation: "Conditions don't change automatically. If it's False, it stays False unless your code changes it."
```

```quiz
id: infinite-loop-prevention
question: "What is the most common cause of infinite loops?"
options:
  - id: a
    text: "Using the wrong comparison operator"
    correct: false
    explanation: "While this can cause problems, it's not the most common cause of infinite loops."
  - id: b
    text: "Forgetting to modify the loop variable inside the loop"
    correct: true
    explanation: "Correct! If the loop variable never changes, the condition never becomes False, creating an infinite loop."
  - id: c
    text: "Using while instead of if"
    correct: false
    explanation: "while and if serve different purposes. Using while is correct when you need repetition."
  - id: d
    text: "Having too many lines of code in the loop"
    correct: false
    explanation: "The number of lines doesn't affect whether a loop terminates - only whether the condition eventually becomes False."
```

## Summary

This section introduced iteration - the systematic repetition of operations:

**While Loops**: Execute code repeatedly while a condition remains true, providing controlled repetition for programs.

**Loop Control**: Counter variables track iterations; accumulator variables collect results; proper variable modification ensures loops terminate.

**Practical Applications**: Input validation, counting operations, and processing multiple data items all rely on iteration patterns.

**Safety**: Every loop must modify its control variable to eventually make the condition false, preventing infinite loops.

Programs can now handle both decision-making (branching) and repetition (iteration) - two fundamental control structures that enable sophisticated algorithmic solutions. The next section introduces collections as the data structures that iteration typically processes.
