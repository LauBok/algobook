# Making Decisions with If Statements

Now that you understand boolean logic from Section 2.1, it's time to make your programs truly intelligent! You know how to create True and False values - now we'll learn how to make your programs **act differently** based on those values.

```note title="The Moment Your Program Gets Smart"
Think of if statements as the moment your program becomes smart. Instead of always doing the same thing, it can now choose what to do based on the situation, just like you do in real life.

🤖 **Before**: Program always does the same thing  
🧠 **After**: Program makes intelligent choices
```

## From Boolean Logic to Program Control

In Section 2.1, you learned how to create True and False values. Now we'll use those boolean values to control what your program does:

```python-execute
# Review: Creating boolean values
age = 17
is_adult = age >= 18

print(f"Age: {age}")
print(f"Is adult: {is_adult}")

# Now let's USE that boolean value to make decisions!
if is_adult:
    print("You can vote!")
    print("You have adult responsibilities.")

print("This line runs regardless of age.")
```

Notice how the program only prints the voting message when `is_adult` is True. When it's False (like with age 17), those lines are skipped entirely.

## If Statement Structure

```note title="If Statement Logic"
An `if` statement is like giving your program instructions for specific situations:

**"IF** this condition is true, **THEN** do these actions."

If the condition is false, your program simply skips those actions and moves on.
```

Every if statement follows this simple pattern - it's like a sentence in English:

```python
if condition:
    # Code that runs when condition is True
    # Note the indentation!
```

```note title="The Four Parts of an If Statement"
1. **`if`** - the keyword that starts the decision
2. **condition** - any expression that gives True or False  
3. **`:`** - the colon that says "here's what to do"
4. **indented code** - the actions to take if condition is True
```

```warning title="Python's Indentation Rule"
Python uses indentation (spaces) to show which code belongs to the if statement. All lines inside the if must be indented the same amount (usually 4 spaces). This is different from languages that use curly braces {}!
```

Let's see this structure in action:

```python-execute
# Simple if statement - code runs only if condition is True
temperature = 85

if temperature > 80:
    print("It's hot outside!")
    print("Remember to drink water!")
    print("Maybe stay in air conditioning.")

print("This line always runs, regardless of temperature.")
```

## If-Else: Handling Both Cases

```note title="Two-Path Decisions"
Real-life decisions usually have two paths:

☔ **"If it's raining, I'll stay inside..."**  
🚶 **"Otherwise, I'll go for a walk."**
```

The `if-else` statement handles both possibilities, **guaranteeing** that exactly one of the two code blocks will run:

```python-execute
# If-else statement handles both True and False cases
score = 85

if score >= 90:
    print("Excellent work! You got an A!")
    print("Keep up the great effort!")
else:
    print("Good job, but there's room for improvement.")
    print("Keep studying and you'll get that A next time!")

print("Thanks for taking the test!")
```

## Interactive Decision Making

```hint title="Here's Where Things Get Exciting!"
Let's combine if-else statements with user input from Chapter 1 to create programs that respond intelligently to what users tell them.

🗨️ **Your programs can now have conversations!**  
🧠 **They make decisions based on user responses!**
```

```python-execute
# Simple password checker
print("=== Security System ===")
correct_password = "secret123"
entered_password = input("Enter password: ")

if entered_password == correct_password:
    print("Access granted! Welcome!")
    print("You are now logged in.")
else:
    print("Access denied! Incorrect password.")
    print("Please try again later.")

print("Security check complete.")
```

```python-execute
# Age verification for voting
print("=== Voting Eligibility Check ===")
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

if age >= 18:
    print("You are eligible to vote!")
    print("Make sure you're registered.")
    print("Your vote matters!")
else:
    years_to_wait = 18 - age
    print(f"You need to wait {years_to_wait} more years to vote.")
    print("But you can still participate in other ways!")

print("Thank you for checking your voting eligibility.")
```

## Multiple Independent Decisions

Sometimes you need to check several different conditions that don't depend on each other. Think of it like a checklist - you want to check each item separately and give advice for each one that applies.

Each `if` statement runs independently - one being true or false doesn't affect the others:

```python-execute
# Weather advisory system
print("=== Weather Advisory ===")
temperature = float(input("Current temperature (°F): "))
is_raining_input = input("Is it raining? (yes/no): ")
is_raining = is_raining_input.lower() == "yes"

# Independent weather checks
if temperature < 32:
    print("FREEZING WARNING: Ice possible on roads!")

if temperature > 95:
    print("HEAT WARNING: Stay hydrated and cool!")

if is_raining:
    print("RAIN ALERT: Don't forget your umbrella!")

if temperature > 70 and is_raining == False:
    print("PERFECT WEATHER: Great day for outdoor activities!")

print("Stay safe out there!")
```

## Nested If Statements: Decisions Within Decisions

Sometimes you need to make a decision, then based on that result, make another decision. It's like asking: "If you qualify for the program, then let's check if you also qualify for the scholarship."

This creates a decision tree where some choices only matter if certain conditions are already met:

```python-execute
# College admission checker
print("=== College Admission Checker ===")
gpa = float(input("Enter your GPA (0.0-4.0): "))
sat_score = int(input("Enter your SAT score: "))

if gpa >= 3.0:
    print("Good GPA! Now checking SAT score...")
    
    if sat_score >= 1200:
        print("Congratulations! You meet admission requirements!")
        print("Strong academics in both GPA and SAT.")
    else:
        print("GPA is good, but SAT score needs improvement.")
        print("Consider retaking the SAT or applying to different schools.")
else:
    print("GPA is below minimum requirement.")
    print("Focus on improving grades before applying.")

print("Admission check complete.")
```

```note title="Nested If Guidelines"
Keep nested if statements simple and not too deep. If you need many levels, there's usually a clearer way to write the logic (which you'll learn in the next section).
```

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Grade Calculator

```python-execute
# Grade calculator with feedback
print("=== Grade Calculator ===")
points_earned = float(input("Points you earned: "))
total_points = float(input("Total points possible: "))

percentage = (points_earned / total_points) * 100

print(f"You scored {percentage:.1f}%")

if percentage >= 90:
    print("Grade: A - Outstanding work!")
else:
    if percentage >= 80:
        print("Grade: B - Good job!")
    else:
        if percentage >= 70:
            print("Grade: C - Acceptable work.")
        else:
            if percentage >= 60:
                print("Grade: D - Needs improvement.")
            else:
                print("Grade: F - Please see instructor.")

print("Keep working hard!")
```

```note title="A Cleaner Way Coming Up!"
Notice how all that nested indentation makes the code hard to read? In the next section, you'll learn about `elif` statements that can make this same logic much cleaner and easier to understand.
```

### Example 2: Simple Calculator

```python-execute
# Basic calculator with operation choice
print("=== Simple Calculator ===")
num1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter second number: "))
operation = input("Enter operation (+, -, *, /): ")

if operation == "+":
    result = num1 + num2
    print(f"{num1} + {num2} = {result}")
else:
    if operation == "-":
        result = num1 - num2
        print(f"{num1} - {num2} = {result}")
    else:
        if operation == "*":
            result = num1 * num2
            print(f"{num1} * {num2} = {result}")
        else:
            if operation == "/":
                if num2 != 0:
                    result = num1 / num2
                    print(f"{num1} / {num2} = {result}")
                else:
                    print("Error: Cannot divide by zero!")
            else:
                print("Error: Invalid operation!")

print("Calculator session complete.")
```

## Practice Exercises

### Quick Check: Age Category Classifier

```exercise
id: age-category-classifier
title: Age Category Classifier
description: Create a program that classifies people into age categories using nested if-else statements.
difficulty: easy
echoInput: true
starterCode: |
  # Age Category Classifier
  # Use nested if-else statements to classify ages into categories
  
  print("=== Age Category Classifier ===")
  age = int(input("Enter age: "))
  
  # Your task: Use nested if-else statements to classify ages:
  # - "Child" for ages 0-12
  # - "Teen" for ages 13-17  
  # - "Adult" for ages 18+
  
  # Write your nested if-else logic here:
testCases:
  - input: "8\n"
    expectedOutput: |
      === Age Category Classifier ===
      Enter age: 8
      Child
    hidden: false
  - input: "16\n"
    expectedOutput: |
      === Age Category Classifier ===
      Enter age: 16
      Teen
    hidden: true
  - input: "25\n"
    expectedOutput: |
      === Age Category Classifier ===
      Enter age: 25
      Adult
    hidden: true
  - input: "0\n"
    expectedOutput: |
      === Age Category Classifier ===
      Enter age: 0
      Child
    hidden: true
  - input: "12\n"
    expectedOutput: |
      === Age Category Classifier ===
      Enter age: 12
      Child
    hidden: true
  - input: "13\n"
    expectedOutput: |
      === Age Category Classifier ===
      Enter age: 13
      Teen
    hidden: true
  - input: "17\n"
    expectedOutput: |
      === Age Category Classifier ===
      Enter age: 17
      Teen
    hidden: true
  - input: "18\n"
    expectedOutput: |
      === Age Category Classifier ===
      Enter age: 18
      Adult
    hidden: true
  - input: "65\n"
    expectedOutput: |
      === Age Category Classifier ===
      Enter age: 65
      Adult
    hidden: true
hints:
  - Use nested if-else statements for each age range
  - Check if age <= 12 first, then <= 17, then adult for the rest
  - This will show you why elif is useful!
solution: |
  print("=== Age Category Classifier ===")
  age = int(input("Enter age: "))
  
  if age <= 12:
      print("Child")
  else:
      if age <= 17:
          print("Teen")
      else:
          print("Adult")
```

## Understanding Python's Indentation: The Key to Clear Code

Python's indentation system is like the paragraph structure in writing - it shows which ideas belong together. For if statements, proper indentation is absolutely critical because it tells Python which lines should run when the condition is true.

Let's see this clearly:

```python-execute
# Correct indentation
temperature = 85

if temperature > 80:
    print("It's hot!")          # This belongs to the if
    print("Stay hydrated!")     # This too
print("Have a great day!")      # This always runs

# The indentation shows Python which lines are part of the if statement
```

```danger title="Indentation Errors"
If your indentation is wrong, Python will give you an "IndentationError". Make sure all lines inside an if statement are indented the same amount!
```

## Check Your Understanding

```quiz
id: if-statement-basics
question: What happens if the condition in an if statement is False?
options:
  - id: a
    text: "The program crashes with an error"
    correct: false
    explanation: A False condition doesn't cause errors - it just means the if block doesn't execute.
  - id: b
    text: "The code inside the if statement is skipped"
    correct: true
    explanation: Correct! When the condition is False, Python skips all the indented code inside the if statement.
  - id: c
    text: "The condition automatically becomes True"
    correct: false
    explanation: Conditions don't change automatically - False stays False.
  - id: d
    text: "Python asks the user what to do"
    correct: false
    explanation: Python follows the logic you write - it doesn't ask users for clarification.
```

```quiz
id: if-else-logic
question: In an if-else statement, when does the else block execute?
options:
  - id: a
    text: "Always, after the if block"
    correct: false
    explanation: The else block only runs when the if condition is False.
  - id: b
    text: "Only when the if condition is True"
    correct: false
    explanation: When the if condition is True, only the if block runs, not the else.
  - id: c
    text: "Only when the if condition is False"
    correct: true
    explanation: Exactly right! The else block runs only when the if condition evaluates to False.
  - id: d
    text: "Never - it's just for decoration"
    correct: false
    explanation: The else block is functional code that executes when the condition is False.
```

```quiz
id: indentation-importance
question: Why is indentation important in Python if statements?
options:
  - id: a
    text: "It makes the code look prettier"
    correct: false
    explanation: While good formatting helps readability, indentation in Python has a functional purpose.
  - id: b
    text: "It tells Python which lines belong to the if statement"
    correct: true
    explanation: Correct! Python uses indentation to determine which lines are part of the if block.
  - id: c
    text: "It's optional - Python works fine without it"
    correct: false
    explanation: Indentation is required in Python. Wrong indentation causes IndentationError.
  - id: d
    text: "It helps the computer run faster"
    correct: false
    explanation: Indentation doesn't affect execution speed - it's about code structure.
```

## What You've Learned

In this section, you've mastered the art of program decision-making:

1. **If Statements** - Execute code only when conditions are true
2. **If-Else Statements** - Handle both true and false cases
3. **Python Indentation** - Use proper indentation to group code
4. **Nested Decisions** - Make decisions within decisions
5. **Interactive Programs** - Combine if statements with user input

You can now create programs that respond intelligently to different situations, making them much more useful and engaging.

## Looking Ahead

You've learned to handle simple decisions with if and if-else. But what if you need to choose between more than two options? In the next section, we'll learn about `elif` (else-if) statements that let you create sophisticated decision trees with multiple branches.

The decision-making skills you've developed here are fundamental to all programming. Every interactive program, game, and application uses these same if-else patterns to create responsive, intelligent behavior.
