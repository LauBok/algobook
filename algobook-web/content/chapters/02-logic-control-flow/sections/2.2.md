# Conditional Execution with If Statements

In previous sections, you learned to think algorithmically and create Boolean expressions. Now you'll discover how to use those Boolean expressions to make programs that can choose different actions based on conditions. This transforms the sequential programs from Chapter 1 into intelligent systems that make decisions.

Recall the contact search algorithm from section 1.1:

> **ALGORITHM: Sequential Contact Search**
> 1. Start at the first contact in the list
> 2. Compare current contact with target name
> 3. **If match found, return contact information**
> 4. If no match, move to next contact
> 5. Repeat until target found or list exhausted

Step 3 contains the key decision: "If match found, return contact information." In section 2.1, you learned to create the Boolean expression `current_contact == target_name` that evaluates this condition. This section introduces if statements that use such Boolean expressions to control program execution, enabling the implementation of algorithmic decisions.

## Basic If Statements

### From Boolean Evaluation to Program Control

If statements provide conditional execution: "IF this condition is true, THEN execute these actions." When the condition is false, the program skips those actions and continues with subsequent code:

```python-execute
# Simple contact search decision
target_name = "Sarah Johnson"
current_contact = "Sarah Johnson"

# Create Boolean expression (from section 2.1)
match_found = current_contact == target_name
print(f"Looking for: {target_name}")
print(f"Current contact: {current_contact}")
print(f"Match found: {match_found}")

# Use if statement to make decision
if match_found:
    print("Success! Contact found!")
    print("Returning contact information...")

print("Continuing search process...")
```

The program prints the success messages only when `match_found` is True. When False (contact names don't match), those lines are skipped entirely, and the program continues with the search process.

### If Statement Syntax

Every if statement follows this pattern:

```python
if condition:
    # Code that runs when condition is True
    # Note the indentation!
```

**The Four Parts of an If Statement:**
1. `if` - the keyword that starts the decision
2. condition - any expression that evaluates to True or False
3. `:` - the colon that indicates the code block
4. indented code - the actions to take if condition is True

```warning title="Python Indentation"
Python uses indentation (spaces) to show which code belongs to the if statement. All lines inside the if must be indented the same amount (usually 4 spaces). This differs from languages that use curly braces.
```

Here's another contact search example:

```python-execute
# Another contact search scenario
target_name = "Bob Smith"
current_contact = "Alice Wilson"

if current_contact == target_name:
    print("Contact found!")
    print("Retrieving contact details...")
    print("Search complete.")

print("Moving to next contact in list...")
```

## If-Else: Binary Decision Structures

The contact search algorithm requires handling both cases: when a match is found AND when no match is found. The `if-else` statement handles both possibilities, guaranteeing that exactly one of the two code blocks will run:

```python-execute
# Complete contact search decision logic
target_name = "Sarah Johnson"
current_contact = "Bob Smith"

if current_contact == target_name:
    print("SUCCESS: Contact found!")
    print("Returning contact information...")
    print("Search complete.")
else:
    print("No match - continuing search...")
    print("Moving to next contact in list...")

print("Contact search step completed.")
```

This if-else structure ensures that the program always takes appropriate action: either it finds the contact and returns the information, or it continues searching through the remaining contacts.

## Implementing Contact Search Logic

Now let's create an interactive contact search program that combines user input with if-else decision making. This demonstrates how the algorithmic thinking from section 1.1 translates into executable code:

```python-execute
# Interactive contact search implementation
print("=== Contact Search System ===")

# Get search criteria from user
target_name = input("Enter name to search for: ")

# Simulate checking a contact (in reality, this would be in a loop)
current_contact = "Sarah Johnson"
print(f"Checking contact: {current_contact}")

# Apply the contact search decision logic
if current_contact == target_name:
    print("SUCCESS: Contact found!")
    print(f"Name: {current_contact}")
    print("Phone: (555) 123-4567")
    print("Email: sarah@email.com")
else:
    print(f"'{current_contact}' is not the target.")
    print("Continuing search...")

print("Search operation complete.")
```

This program implements the core decision from the contact search algorithm: "If match found, return contact information." The if-else structure handles both outcomes, making the program robust and complete.

## Advanced Decision Patterns

### User Authentication

Another common application of if-else logic is user authentication, which requires verifying credentials:

```python-execute
# User authentication for contact system
print("=== Contact System Login ===")
correct_password = "contact123"
entered_password = input("Enter password: ")

if entered_password == correct_password:
    print("Access granted! Welcome to Contact System!")
    print("You can now search contacts.")
else:
    print("Access denied! Incorrect password.")
    print("Contact system access restricted.")

print("Authentication complete.")
```

### Multiple Independent Decisions

Sometimes programs must check several independent conditions. Each `if` statement runs independently, creating a checklist of conditions to evaluate. This is useful when multiple criteria can be true simultaneously:

```python-execute
# Contact search with additional criteria
print("=== Enhanced Contact Search ===")
target_name = input("Enter name to search for: ")
current_contact = "Sarah Johnson"

# Multiple independent checks
if current_contact == target_name:
    print("SUCCESS: Name match found!")

if len(current_contact) > 10:
    print("NOTE: Contact has a long name.")

if "Johnson" in current_contact:
    print("INFO: Contact is part of Johnson family.")

if current_contact.startswith("S"):
    print("INFO: Contact name starts with 'S'.")

print("Contact analysis complete.")
```

### Simple Nested Decisions

Sometimes you need to make a decision within another decision. For contact systems, you might first check if access is granted, then check what type of search to perform:

```python-execute
# Contact system with nested access control
print("=== Secure Contact Search ===")
password = input("Enter password: ")

if password == "admin123":
    print("Admin access granted!")

    search_type = input("Search by (name/phone): ")
    if search_type == "name":
        print("Name search activated.")
        print("Ready to search by contact name.")
    else:
        print("Phone search activated.")
        print("Ready to search by phone number.")
else:
    print("Access denied. Cannot perform search.")

print("System ready.")
```

Keep nested if statements simple and not too deep. When you have many options to check, there are clearer ways to write the logic (covered in the next section with elif statements).

```warning title="Python Indentation"
Python uses indentation to determine which code belongs to each if statement. All lines inside an if block must be indented the same amount (usually 4 spaces). Incorrect indentation causes an "IndentationError".
```

## Assessment and Practice

### Practice Exercises

```exercise
id: age-category-classifier
title: Age Category Classifier
description: Create a program that classifies people into age categories using nested if-else statements. Notice how the nesting gets unwieldy!
difficulty: easy
echoInput: true
starterCode: |
  # Age Category Classifier
  # Use nested if-else statements to classify ages into categories

  print("=== Age Category Classifier ===")
  age = int(input("Enter age: "))

  # Your task: Use nested if-else statements to classify ages:
  # - "Child" for ages 0-12
  # - "Teen" for ages 13-17
  # - "Adult" for ages 18+

  # Write your nested if-else logic here:
  # Notice how the indentation gets deeper with each condition!
testCases:
  - input: "8\n"
    expectedOutput: |
      === Age Category Classifier ===
      Enter age: 8
      Child
    hidden: false
  - input: "16\n"
    expectedOutput: |
      === Age Category Classifier ===
      Enter age: 16
      Teen
    hidden: true
  - input: "25\n"

  - input: "0\n"
    expectedOutput: |
      === Age Category Classifier ===
      Enter age: 0
      Child
    hidden: true
  - input: "12\n"
    expectedOutput: |
      === Age Category Classifier ===
      Enter age: 12
      Child
    hidden: true
  - input: "13\n"
    expectedOutput: |
      === Age Category Classifier ===
      Enter age: 13
      Teen
    hidden: true
  - input: "17\n"
    expectedOutput: |
      === Age Category Classifier ===
      Enter age: 17
      Teen
    hidden: true
  - input: "18\n"
    expectedOutput: |
      === Age Category Classifier ===
      Enter age: 18
      Adult
    hidden: true
  - input: "65\n"
    expectedOutput: |
      === Age Category Classifier ===
      Enter age: 65
      Adult
    hidden: true
hints:
  - "Use nested if-else statements for each age range"
  - "Check if age <= 12 first, then <= 17, then adult for the rest"
  - "Notice how the indentation gets deeper with each condition - this shows why elif is needed!"
  - "The nested structure makes the code harder to read - next section introduces a cleaner way!"
solution: |
  print("=== Age Category Classifier ===")
  age = int(input("Enter age: "))
  
  if age <= 12:
      print("Child")
  else:
      if age <= 17:
          print("Teen")
      else:
          print("Adult")
```

### Knowledge Assessment

```quiz
id: if-statement-basics
question: What happens if the condition in an if statement is False?
options:
  - id: a
    text: "The program crashes with an error"
    correct: false
    explanation: A False condition doesn't cause errors - it just means the if block doesn't execute.
  - id: b
    text: "The code inside the if statement is skipped"
    correct: true
    explanation: Correct! When the condition is False, Python skips all the indented code inside the if statement.
  - id: c
    text: "The condition automatically becomes True"
    correct: false
    explanation: Conditions don't change automatically - False stays False.
  - id: d
    text: "Python asks the user what to do"
    correct: false
    explanation: Python follows the logic you write - it doesn't ask users for clarification.
```

```quiz
id: if-else-logic
question: In an if-else statement, when does the else block execute?
options:
  - id: a
    text: "Always, after the if block"
    correct: false
    explanation: The else block only runs when the if condition is False.
  - id: b
    text: "Only when the if condition is True"
    correct: false
    explanation: When the if condition is True, only the if block runs, not the else.
  - id: c
    text: "Only when the if condition is False"
    correct: true
    explanation: Exactly right! The else block runs only when the if condition evaluates to False.
  - id: d
    text: "Never - it's just for decoration"
    correct: false
    explanation: The else block is functional code that executes when the condition is False.

  - id: d
    text: "It helps the computer run faster"
    correct: false
    explanation: Indentation doesn't affect execution speed - it's about code structure.
```

## Summary

This section introduced conditional execution that transforms sequential programs into intelligent decision-making systems:

**Core Concepts:**
- **If statements:** Execute code only when conditions are True
- **If-else structures:** Handle both True and False cases completely
- **Contact search implementation:** Applied conditional logic to implement algorithmic decisions
- **Multiple independent conditions:** Check several criteria simultaneously
- **Simple nested decisions:** Make decisions within other decisions

**Key Learning:**
You can now implement the "If match found, return contact information" step from the contact search algorithm using if-else statements. This bridges the gap between algorithmic thinking and executable code.

**What's Next:** The next section introduces `elif` statements that provide a cleaner alternative to deeply nested if-else structures, making complex decision logic more readable and maintainable.
