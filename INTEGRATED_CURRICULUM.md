- **Capstone Projects**: Major integrative challenges demonstrating mastery

### **Mathematical Sophistication Options:**
- **Core Mathematical Concepts**: Essential ideas woven into main narrative
- **Deep Dive Boxes**: Advanced mathematical treatment for interested students
- **Quick Reference Appendix**: Notation, proof techniques, and complexity functions
- **As-Needed Introduction**: Mathematical tools introduced exactly when algorithms require them

### **Immediate Application with Long-Term Integration:** 
- Practice problems integrate Python, algorithms, data structures, AND theory
- No pure syntax exercises - always algorithmic and mathematical context
- Interactive coding challenges reinforce all components simultaneously
- **Capstone Projects** demonstrate synthesis across multiple parts of curriculum

### **Assessment Philosophy:**
This enhanced curriculum maintains constant student motivation through immediate problem-solving while building deep theoretical understanding. Students learn Python features exactly when needed, develop algorithmic thinking through hands-on implementation, and master theoretical foundations through guided discovery rather than abstract presentation.

The multi-modal assessment system ensures students develop both practical implementation skills and theoretical reasoning abilities, preparing them for both industry work and further academic study. Capstone projects provide substantial portfolio pieces demonstrating mastery of integrated concepts from each major curriculum section.
